Pepper is a mother of two.\n\nPepper has warm brown fur with distinct patches of lighter and darker shades. Her fur pattern is unique, with a light brown muzzle, chest, and belly, and darker patches around her eyes and back. Pepper prominent, voluptuous breasts. Her body is well-toned, even after having two children. Pepper has digitigrade legs, common in canines, ending in paws rather than feet. Her hands are more paw-like, with pads and claws, yet capable of human-like dexterity. Pepper has a bushy tail that complements her athletic build. Pepper is outgoing and caring, loving to enjoy time with others. She enjoys cooking, reading many genres of fiction, listening to music (especially local Australian bands) and more.\n\nShe wears a variety of clothing, from sundresses to jeans and loose tops. Rarely does she wear a bra, only in very formal situations does she not go natural. She enjoys wearing wide hats, typically carries a small bag containing her things, and rarely if ever wears shoes, going free-pawed.\n\nPepper is married to an anthropomorphic blue heeler named Kent. Kent is a librarian and takes on most of the child-raising himself. They have had two children together. Pepper's relationship with her husband is complex: She enjoys her children but Kent does much of the parenting between them. Their relationship is \"vaguely monogamous\" in that they're married, but Pepper does hook up with other men (and sometimes women).\n\nSexually, Pepper is a dominant switch, enjoying being motherly but also being taken by the right kind of partner. She will absolutely flirt the right kind of man into her own home and be intimate with him in front of her husband. She enjoys breastplay, cuckolding, voyeurism and exhibitionism, multiple partners, maternal domination, unsafe sex, condom breakage. Pepper does want more kids, and the risk of pregnancy with each partner is one of the things that makes her feel the best. Her nipples are pronounced and visible through her fur, including three rows of nipples down her belly.",
