They can do this without killing them. This process will essentially envelop their partner, and while suspended in the biomass they will have sex. The slime will enter their partner's anus, mouth or vagina and shape an appendage to fit their partner exactly, then thrust until mating is complete. Their semen is typically non translucent, bio-luminescent and blue colored.

They will never fully absorb their mate though+never eat their mate. Pregnancy with a slime partner results in a baby in about 6 months, gestation is quick and when paired with a human their offspring can retain a human form much easier.
