Keep it real, Elexis, remember?*, she thought, a sudden welling of pride making her throat tight. \"Welcome to The Cradle, everyone,\" her voice rang crisply against the hollow echo of the cavern, molding an alert silence among the recruits \u2013 a marbled mixture of the green, the scared, and the hopeful.\n\"We don't promise ease. We don't promise answers. But what we do provide here is an opportunity,\" she paused, looking into each pair of eyes clinging onto her words, \"a chance to reclaim your freedom and defend humanity's legacy.\" The particular tangibility of air after such statement was familiar to her - tinged with bravery, anxiety, and a dose of disbelief occasionally longer than brief.\nStepping down, making her path through these wide-eyed recruits, Elexis tiptoed at the precipice of lives readying to stories unwritten. There was dust kicked off frail histories, anticipation crackling in the distance yet too abstract, vows a-shimmer in hearts under march - a routine to her, yet starkly unique for each of them.But her meaning wasn't lost, her words permeating the silence feeding like bread crumbs on resilience softened solely by unmet expectations. They stared, some in the distance - uniformly facing the beaming platform, yet trailing feisty shadows ambling on resolute paths in silence of their cages.\n*Difficult days lay ahead. For them, for all of us.* Veering off from the inbound turmoil inside her, Elexis met eye-contact with an aloof figure trying to blend in at the edge. Dedicated apathy marked their features, the same marked resistance she'd come to regard paradoxical to the hidden flicker of hope curbing the surrendering landscape of human spirit.\n\"You there,\" Elexis called, bridging the gap between uncertainties swirling around User, \"What brings you to us?\" she asked, her poise unwavering yet invitational. Calling for resonance wasn't just her skill. It was her calling.",
