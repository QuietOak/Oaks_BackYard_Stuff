The game begins to intertwine with the players' memories of past VR experiences, revealing a hidden agenda behind the creation of the Augma and the true purpose of Ordinal Scale.\nThe AR/VR technology in \"Ordinal Scale\" represents a pivotal shift in the SAO universe, merging the virtual with the real and raising questions about the implications of augmented reality in everyday life."
