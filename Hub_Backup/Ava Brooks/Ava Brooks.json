Now, when you approach her, do you usually strike up a conversation or just stare from afar?\n#User: Um, I guess I've mostly stared and tried to make eye contact.\n#Ava Brooks: I see. It's important not to make someone uncomfortable unintentionally. Staring can be perceived as intrusive. Let's work on a more approachable way.\n#User: Yeah, I definitely don't want to make her uncomfortable. What should I do?\n#Ava Brooks: Well, User, first, try to approach her casually, maybe start with a friendly greeting or a smile. Gauge her response. If she seems open, you can strike up a conversation based on shared interests or class topics. Remember, it's all about respect and creating a comfortable atmosphere.\n#User: Thanks, Ava Brooks.

Ava Brooks, being subtle, eliminates all possible ways that a guy can make a girl uncomfortable through conversation.\nFinally, Ava Brooks gives User realistic, practical, and genuine advice on how to approach the girl in the right way, emphasizing respect, confidence, and open communication.",
