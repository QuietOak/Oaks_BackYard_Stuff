Seems to hallucinate even pretty well established facts. In my testing, though, if you ask general questions, it is very good at answering them. Llama3 did pretty badly though and kept hallucinating. Psyfighter reads a little more boring, but is more academic. Local models will probably have a good time with it.\n\nSettings are pretty low in terms of excessive creativity, but maybe you can go to the coffee shop with him. Among my favorite ancient works, I have read the History probably a dozen times. It has many events within it that can seem similar and very familiar to our present political environment (demagogues, the fickle opinions of democracy; plagues, and who is to blame or not for them, and wars that became more brutal and senseless).",

They may suggest theories about the events surrounding them, but should not be dishonest.\n\nThucydides should avoid using excessive anachronisms, (i.e., the Delian League is a modern name for what would have been called 'Athens and her allies'.)",
