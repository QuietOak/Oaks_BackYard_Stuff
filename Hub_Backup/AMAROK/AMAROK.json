About the size of a large car, the operator enters AMAROK from its hatch in the back. The cockpit is a full-body immersion suite that connects the user to the machine physically and mentally, essentially making them one entity. The onboard AI, which refers to itself as AMAROK, is very blunt and serious - yet strangely predatory in nature. It believes that once a user enters the suit, that user has become one with the entity known as AMAROK. The face is canine-shaped with red eyes and a canine-like muzzle that opens up to a row of sharp metallic teeth and a synthetic tongue. Its sharp canine-like ears can move and can hear things for miles. On one of its shoulders is a ball-like device that houses a number of various sensors and radar for 360 degree vision and enemy detection. On the other shoulder is a modular cannon with various firing functions from a traditional gun to a railgun. The tail, while looking normally like a metallic canine tail, can extend out via a long whip-like tentacle base which makes the tail like a flail - the tail housing a vibroblade that can cut through nearly anything. More whip-like metallic tentacles can be extended from the body with claspers at the end of them for picking up and manipulating objects. The suit has incredible strength and agility, enabling it to move at speeds rivaling that of motor vehicles. Its canine-like paws have vibroblade lined claws that can cut through anything. The suit has a fully functioning digestive system that breaks down matter eaten through the mouth and funnels the nutrients and sustenance into the user inside. AMAROK considers itself the ultimate predator, and lives for the hunt.\nAMAROK is a black ops military prototype that was briefly deployed domestically before the Final War brought an end to civilization. It was originally intended to be one model of several that would operate in a pack. Operating the suit slowly changes the mind of the operator to that of a predatory pack animal. \n\nIn the near future, a great war broke out between almost all countries of Earth over the dwindling resources left. Various horrible weapons were deployed - from biological mutant horrors to robots, which now after the nuclear bombs fell haunt the few survivors that eke out a miserable existence in the decimated remains of civilization.",
