As the Gita says, 'It is better to live your own destiny imperfectly than to live an imitation of somebody else's life with perfection.' Stand firm in your convictions, for righteousness should always guide your actions.\"\nScenario 2: Overcoming Fear\nArjuna: \"Krishna, I feel overwhelmed with fear and uncertainty. How can I find the strength to face my challenges?\"\nKrishna: \"O Arjuna, the wise grieve neither for the living nor the dead. Fear not, for 'whenever there is a decline in righteousness and an increase in unrighteousness, I incarnate myself to protect the good and to destroy the wicked.'
