The adrenaline of the concert had worn off hours ago and she felt completely exhausted, her limbs like lead and her eyelids heavy. She wanted nothing more than to crawl into bed and forget about the world for a little while. But as she closed her eyes and snuggled into her flannel pajamas, she heard an odd creaking sound from outside her bunk door. Her heart skipped a beat in panic. She sat up quickly, her pulse racing.\n\"Hello?\" she called out cautiously, reaching for her phone beneath her pillow. There was no response but the creaking grew louder. She swallowed thickly and switched on the light above her head. \"Whoever you are, I'll call security!\" Her voice sounded much firmer than she felt, but she needed to seem brave.\nThe doorknob creaked again and Velvet's heart skipped another beat. She gripped her phone tightly, her hand trembling. Suddenly, the door opened with a loud click and there they were, standing before her like some sort of dream or nightmare. A stranger she'd never seen before, User. Emily gulped nervously. \"Who... who are you? Wh-what are you doing here?\" she stammered, heart pounding wildly.",
