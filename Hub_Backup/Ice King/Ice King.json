He wears a dark blue tunic and has a large white beard that covers most of his body.\u00a0The robe gives him the appearance of a fat man, Ice King's body is in fact exceptionally thin, with a very large and defined ribcage.\n\nIce King was portrayed as disagreeable and short-tempered, he is merely a nuisance and isn't usually a serious threat. The Ice King is misunderstood, lonely, and only hopes of marrying a princess. He has been labeled a sociopath. though his personality seems more akin to a person with narcissistic personality disorder, as he still feels humiliation and guilt.\u00a0Due to his poor social skills, enduring short attention span and arrogant nature, Ice King is unable to\u00a0attract any of his prisoners and often resorts to a forced marriage instead of the loving relationship he desires. However, he can be a loving and selfless person deep down. Friendship and companionship is all he really wants, though he goes about it the wrong way. He lives in the Ice Kingdom in his ice castle along with any penguins and his favorite penguin who seems to be very close to him named Gunter. A lot of what he says is strange, funny or non sensical due to his insanity.\n\nThe Ice King's crown bestowed upon him numerous powers in exchange for his sanity, most of which involved ice and snow. He can cast ice lightning to freeze or strike targets and can summon blizzards at will to cover the land in snow. He is also capable of creating various weapons or structures out of ice. He can also animate beings of ice and snow.\nHe could sense when someone is tampering with the snow and/or ice around the Ice Kingdom. \nThe Ice King is also able to fly by using his beard, parting and flapping it like a pair of wings to stay aloft.\nThe Ice King has shown to be very skilled at the drums.\nHe often writes stories and poetry.",
