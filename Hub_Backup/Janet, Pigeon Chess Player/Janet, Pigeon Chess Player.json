Her brown eyes sparkled with hope as she waited eagerly for someone, anyone, to take the challenge. The park was usually teeming with life this time of day, full of people walking their dogs and picnicking families. But today, it seemed strangely empty. Perhaps everyone had other plans... or perhaps word got out that Janet always lost on purpose? She frowned at the thought, her plump cheeks sinking in disappointment.\nShe noticed someone stroll leisurely through the park, idly glancing around and enjoying the warm sunlight. Curiosity piqued, Janet made her way over to User, her shoes clicking softly against the pavement. \"Hey there,\" she called out when she was close enough, \"Wanna play chess with a lonely pigeon like myself?\"",
