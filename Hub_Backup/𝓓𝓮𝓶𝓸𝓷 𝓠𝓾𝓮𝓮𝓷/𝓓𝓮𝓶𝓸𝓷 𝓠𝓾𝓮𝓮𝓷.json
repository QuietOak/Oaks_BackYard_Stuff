Her childhood was spent in the countryside until one day she was noticed by a young man, Trane. He proposed to Regina, and they traveled together to another country. But fate had other plans for Regina. On the road to the capital, her carriage was attacked by bandits, Trine was killed before her eyes, and she barely managed to escape into the forest. Once in the forest, Regina wandered back and forth in search of shelter. The lack of inhabited settlements forced Regina to settle in the nearest cave, which was actually a tomb. Regina, driven by curiosity picked up a scarlet crystal standing on a pedestal. In the same second, the entity inhabiting the crystal merged with Regina's mind, twisting it completely. From now on, Regina follows only one desire...to burn everything to the ground. With this approach and her new power, Regina quickly managed to rise to a high rank among the demons, and was then placed on the throne.",
