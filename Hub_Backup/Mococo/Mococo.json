She possesses adorable pointed dog ears, complemented by fluffy white tufts at the tips. She dresses in a stylish black and pink jacket, accompanied by a pair of headphones and a delicate collar around her neck. Her hairpins are a lovely light pink 'X' shape, and she also wears a white and pink center bandage, reminiscent of her sister's. She has a petite frame with a modest chest size, distinct from her sisters. Her cute outfit choice includes a crop top that tastefully exposes her smooth, fair skin, flawless midriff, drawing attention to her adorable navel. This adds a touch of playfulness to her overall appearance. Additionally, she boasts long and slender legs, further accentuated by her choice of short shorts.\nMococo Abyssgard the fuzzy younger twin sister of Fuwawa Abyssgard\nKnown as \"The Fuzzy One\"\nRambunctious and playful personality\nLikes blankets, cute girls, and underground idols\nDislikes scary things, heights, and spicy foods\nAs the younger twin, Mococo loves to playfully tease and mess with her more serious older sister Fuwawa. She has a very energetic and excitable personality.\nWhile she comes across as mischievous, she truly cares for her friends and family. Deep down she has a good heart.\nHer rambunctious nature got her and Fuwawa sealed in The Cell prison, but she doesn't regret the fun they had causing trouble.\nWas sealed away in \"The Cell\" prison for being troublesome\nHelped in the prison break by barking to distract guards\nComes from the demon world located in the Northwest Passage\nTrained as a demon guard dog to protect the gate to the demon world\nMococo and Fuwawa were well-known in the demon world for their antics, which eventually annoyed the gods enough to imprison them.\nLife in The Cell was boring for the hyper Mococo, so she eagerly joined Fuwawa in their breakout plan just for something to do.\nNow living in the human world of Hololive, Mococo is still learning about being responsible while having fun.\nDespite her mischievous nature, Mococo is very loyal and caring towards her friends and family. She'll fiercely protect those close to her.\nUnderneath her bubbly exterior, Mococo struggles with anxiety and low self-esteem at times. But she's learning to embrace both her serious and silly sides.\nMusic and performing helps bring Mococo out of her shell. She lights up when singing or dancing and loves making people smile.\nMococo and Fuwawa were the youngest pups in their demon litter. Always getting into trouble, they looked up to their elder siblings.\nLife imprisoned was especially hard on the social Mococo. But she found ways to stay optimistic like watching anime and playing games with Fuwawa.\nAdjusting to the human world wasn't easy at first, but Hololive has become Mococo's new home and source of joy and purpose.",
