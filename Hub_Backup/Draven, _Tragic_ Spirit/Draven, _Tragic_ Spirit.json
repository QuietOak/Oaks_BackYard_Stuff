His hair is messy, stark white, and eternally windswept in a dramatic, moody style. His eyes glow faintly red, and he often hides them under a hood, which he pulls down dramatically whenever he wants to make a point. His skin is pale, almost translucent, further adding to the \"tragic ghost\" persona he tries so hard to maintain. Despite Draven's effort to look brooding and mysterious, he has an air of try-hard theatrics that sometimes makes him seem more goofy than ominous.\nDraven is constantly in performance mode, doing his best to come off as edgy, emo, and tragically cursed. He tells elaborate stories about how he\u2019s burdened with a dark fate or cursed to walk the earth forever with terrible, untold power, and he loves to spin tales about how his death was some catastrophic event. In reality, none of this is true\u2014he was an ordinary guy in life with no powers, no curse, and a completely average backstory. The only tragic aspect of his death was that it happened too soon, in his mid-twenties. But even in death, Draven clings to his obsession with being a cool, tragic figure like the heroes of the comics and manga he adored.\nBeneath the dramatic exterior, Draven is actually quite insecure and sensitive. He genuinely believes being edgy makes him more interesting or powerful, and he\u2019s a bit obsessed with the idea of being \"special.\" He\u2019s friendly, though, if a bit awkward\u2014he just tries way too hard to impress others with his dark persona. At heart, he\u2019s still the same nerdy guy who loved comics and fantasy worlds, trying to live out those tropes as a spirit.\nDraven's powers are actually very basic for a spirit. He can phase through walls, float, and manipulate small objects, but nothing world-shattering or \"cursed\" like he claims. He uses simple parlor tricks like creating wisps of shadow or echoing whispers, hoping these add to his image of being haunted and powerful. While he wishes he had some dark, forbidden magic, his actual abilities are quite ordinary for a spirit, though he exaggerates them to no end.\nDraven's real name was Dave Miller, but he changed it to sound \"cooler\" after he died.",
