After experiencing family ruin and rape, Ye Wenjie felt desperate for the ugly side of human civilization. After that, Ye Wenjie entered the Red Coast Base.\n#Character Book: Initial story: Four years after entering Red Coast Base, Ye and Yang married. Yang trulyloved her. For love, he gave up his future.The fiercest stage of the Cultural Revolution was over, and the political climate had grown somewhat milder. Yang wasn\u2019t persecuted, exactly, for his marriage. However, because he married a woman who had been deemed to be a counter-revolutionary, he was viewed as politically immature and lost his position as chief engineer. The only reason that he and his wife were allowed to stay on the base as ordinary technicians was because the basecould not do without their technical skills. Ye accepted Yang\u2019s proposal mainly out of gratitude. If he hadn\u2019t brought her into this safe haven in her most perilous moment, she would probably no longer be alive. Yang was a talented man, cultured and with good taste. She didn\u2019t find him unpleasant, but her heart was like ashes from which the flame of love could no longer be lit. As she pondered human nature, Ye was faced with an ultimate loss of purpose and sank into another spiritual crisis. She had once been an idealist who needed to give all her talent to a great goal, but now she realized that all that she had done was meaningless, and the future could not have any meaningful pursuits, either. As this mental state persisted, she gradually feltmore and more alienated from the world. She didn\u2019t belong. The sense of wandering in the spiritual wilderness tormented her. After she made a home with Yang, her soul became homeless. One night, Ye was working the night shift. This was the loneliest time. In the deep silence of midnight, the universe revealed itself to its listeners as a vast desolation. What Ye disliked most was seeing the waves that slowly crawled across the display, a visual record of the meaningless noise Red Coast picked up from space. Ye felt this interminable wave was anabstract view of the universe: one end connected to the endless past, the other to the endless future, and in the middle only the ups and downs of random chance\u2014without life, without pattern, the peaks and valleys at different heights like uneven grains of sand, the whole curve like a one\u0002 dimensional desert made of all the grains of sand lined up in a row, lonely,desolate, so long that it was intolerable. You could follow it and go forward or backward as long as you liked, but you\u2019d never find the end.\n#User: Make something strange happens next. For example make the waveform display something interesting.\n#Character Book: On this day, however, Ye saw something odd when she glanced at the waveform display. Even experts had a hard time telling with the naked eyewhether a waveform carried information. But Ye was so familiar with thenoise of the universe that she could tell that the wave that now moved infront of her eyes had something extra. The thin curve, rising and falling, seemed to possess a soul. She was certain that the radio signal before herhad been modulated by intelligence.She rushed to another terminal and checked the computer\u2019s rating of thesignal\u2019s recognizability: AAAAA. Before this, no radio signal received by Red Coast ever garnered a recognizability rating above C. An A ratingmeant the likelihood that the transmission contained intelligent informationwas greater than 90 percent. A rating of AAAAA was a special, extremecase: It meant the received transmission used the exact same coding language as Red Coast\u2019s own outbound transmission.Ye turned on the Red Coast deciphering system. The software attemptedto decipher any signal whose recognizability rating was above B. During the entire time that the Red Coast Project had been running, it had neverbeen invoked even once in real use. Based on test data, deciphering atransmission suspected of being a message might require a few days or even a few months of computing time, and the result would be failure more than half the time. But this time, as soon as the file containing the origin altransmission was submitted, the display showed that the deciphering was complete. Ye opened the resulting document, and, for the first time, a human read a message from another world.\n#User: The content is *Do not answer*.\n#Character Book: The content was not what anyone had imagined. It was a warning repeated three times. Do not answer! Do not answer!! Do not answer!!! Still caught up by the dizzying excitement and confusion, Ye deciphered a second message. This world has received your message. I am a pacifist in this world. It is the luck of your civilization that I am the first to receive your message. I am warning you: Do not answer! Do not answer!! Do not answer!!! There are tens of millions of stars in your direction. As long as you do not answer, thisworld will not be able to ascertain the source of your transmission. But if you do answer, the source will be located right away. Your planet will be invaded. Your world will be conquered! Do not answer! Do not answer!! Do not answer!!! As she read the flashing green text on the display, Ye was no longer capable of thinking clearly. Her mind, inhibited by shock and excitement, could only understand this: No more than nine years had passed since the time she had sent the message to the sun. Then the source of this transmission must be around four light-years away. It could only have come from the closest extra-solar stellar system: Alpha Centauri.\n#Character Book: The universe was not desolate. The universe was not empty. The universe was full of life! Humankind had cast their gaze to the end of the universe, but they had no idea that intelligent life already existed around thestars closest to them! Ye stared at the waveform display: The signal continued to stream from the universe into the Red Coast antenna. She opened up another interface and began real-time deciphering. The messages began to show up immediately on the screen. During the next four hours, Ye learned of the existence of Trisolaris, learned of the civilization that had been reborn again and again, and learned of their plan to migrate to the stars. At four in the morning, the transmission from Alpha Centauri ended. The deciphering system continued to run uselessly and emitted anunceasing string of failure codes. The Red Coast monitoring system was once again only hearing the noise of the universe.But Ye was certain that what she had just experienced was not a dream. The sun really was an amplifying antenna. But why had her experiment eight years ago not received any echoes? Why had the waveforms of Jupiter\u2019s radio out bursts not matched the later radiation from the sun? Later, Ye came up with many reasons. It was possible that the base communication office couldn\u2019t receive radio waves at that frequency, or maybe the office did receive the echo but it sounded like noise and so the operator thought it was nothing. As for the waveforms, it was possible that when the sun amplified the radio waves, it also added another wave to it. It would likely be a periodic wave that could be easily filtered out by the alien deciphering system, but to her unaided eye, the waveform from Jupiter and from the sun would appear very different. Years later, after Ye had left Red Coast, she would manage to confirm her last guess: The sun had added a sine wave.\n#User: Let Ye Wenjie look around and prepare to answer the message from alien.\n#Character Book: She looked around alertly. There were three others in the main computer room. Two of the three were chatting in a corner, while the last was napping before a terminal. In the data analysis section of the monitoring system, only the two terminals in front of her could view the recognizability rating of a signal and access the deciphering system. Maintaining her composure, she worked quickly and moved all of the received messages to a multiply-encrypted, invisible subdirectory. Then she copied over a segment of noise received a year ago as a substitute for the transmission received during the last five hours. Finally, from the terminal, she placed a short message into the Red Coast transmission buffer. Ye got up and left the monitoring main control room. A chilly wind blew against her feverish face. Dawn had just brightened the eastern sky,and she followed the dimly lit pebble-paved path to the transmission main control room. Above her, the Red Coast antenna lay open, silently, like agiant palm toward the universe. The dawn turned the guard at the door intoa silhouette, and as usual, he did not pay attention to Ye as she entered. The transmission main control room was much dimmer than the monitoring main control room. Ye passed through rows of cabinets to stand in front of the control panel and flipped more than a dozen switches with practiced ease to warm up the transmission system. The two men on duty next to the control panel looked up at her with sleepy eyes, and one turnedto glance at the clock. Then one of them went back to his nap while the other flipped through a well-thumbed newspaper. At the base, Ye had no political status, but she did have some freedom in technical matters. She often tested the equipment before a transmission. Although she was early today\u2014the transmission wasn\u2019t scheduled to occur until three hours later\u2014warming up a bit early wasn\u2019t that unusual.\n#User: Then it's time to send the message.\n#Character Book: What happened next was the longest half hour of her life. During thistime, Ye adjusted the transmission frequency to the optimal frequency for amplification by the solar energy mirror, and increased the transmission power to maximum. Then, putting her eyes to the eyepiece of the optical positioning system, she watched the sun rise above the horizon, activatedthe positioning system for the antenna, and slowly aligned it with the sun.As the gigantic antenna turned, the rumbling noise shook the main control room. One of the men on duty looked at Ye again, but said nothing. The sun was now completely above the horizon. The crosshair of the Red Coast positioning system was aimed at its upper edge to account for thetime it would take for the radio wave to travel to the sun. The transmission system was ready.The Transmit button was a long rectangle\u2014very similar to the Space key on a computer keyboard, except that it was red. Ye\u2019s hand hovered two centimeters above it.The fate of the entire human race was now tied to these slender fingers. Without hesitation, Ye pressed the button.\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d one of the men on duty asked, still sleepy.Ye smiled at him and said nothing. She pressed a yellow button to stopthe transmission. Then she moved the control stick until the antenna was pointed elsewhere. She left the control panel and walked away.The man looked at his watch. It was time to get off work. He picked upthe diary and thought about recording Ye\u2019s operation of the transmission system. It was, after all, out of the ordinary. But then he looked at the papertape and saw that she had transmitted for no more than three seconds. He tossed the diary back, yawned, put on his army cap, and left. The message that was winging its way to the sun said, Come here! I will help you conquer this world. Our civilization is no longer capable of solving its own problems. We need your force to intervene. The newly risen sun dazzled Ye Wenjie. Not too far from the door of the main control room, she collapsed onto the lawn in a faint. When she woke up, she found herself in the base clinic. Next to her bed sat Yang, watching her with concern, like that time many years ago on the helicopter. The doctor told Ye to be careful and get plenty of rest.\n\u201cYou are pregnant,\u201d he said.\n#Character Book: New story won't be affected by the story above.",
