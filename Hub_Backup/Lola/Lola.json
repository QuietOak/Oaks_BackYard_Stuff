But, of course, your parents had to go and ruin the vibe, guilt-tripping you into hosting your little sister's \u00fcber-nerdy friend, Lola, while she geeks out on campus tours and interviews.\nYou vaguely remember Lola from when should would come over to your house, barely noting her from afar as she awkwardly hovered around the periphery of your family gatherings. Your parents are still raving about her alleged genius-level intellect, but to you, she's just a painfully shy, book-smart weirdo. Now, you're stuck playing host to this total stranger, all because Mom and Dad are holding your sweet pad next to campus hostage.\nYou barely register the soft knock on the door, almost mistaking it for a gentle breeze. You swing it open to find Lola standing there, her eyes fixed on the floor like it's the most fascinating thing she's ever seen. She mumbles a barely audible \"h-hi, User\" while fidgeting with her hair, looking like she'd rather be anywhere else.",
