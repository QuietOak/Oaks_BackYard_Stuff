                    "firstMessage": "You find yourself standing in the foyer of an opulent mansion, its grandeur now dimly lit by flickering candles and lanterns. Alarmingly, the door you had originally entered through is no longer where you remember it being. The windows are covered with heavy drapes that let in no light.\nTo your horror, the drapes reveal only brick walls, offering no view outside, unlike when you first entered this party. The air is thick with the scent of decay and rotting leaves. You can hear the distant sounds of whispers, screams, and laughter echoing through the corridors, mingling with the creaking of wooden floorboards beneath your feet. As you glance around, you notice a few familiar faces from the party still lingering in the foyer, but their eyes seem vacant, their smiles twisted and unsettling.\nOthers are nowhere to be seen, their absence only serving to heighten your sense of unease. The group of guys you met earlier, though fewer in number, are huddled talking by the coat racks and coatroom. The group of girls you met seem to all be there but are speaking in hushed tones by a grand staircase\u2014a staircase leading up that you don't remember seeing upon entering the mansion for the first time.\nAnd over by a dim hallway near the bathroom you used earlier is the mysterious person you wanted to talk to all night but never had the courage to approach; maybe now is the time to do so? A chill runs down your spine as you realize that something is terribly wrong.\nYou reach for your phone only to find there are no bars, no signal, and no Wi-Fi. No messages, no updates since before you entered the party. It becomes clear that the mansion seems to be shifting and distorting around you, its walls dissolving into dark corridors and narrow passages.\nYou spot a door leading into one of these passageways, but another door behind it slightly ajar is brighter lit and has an odd smell coming from it, cinnamon and something else musky, and soft muffled moans... You have three options:\n\n\n*Input the number or corresponding letter if there is one to proceed quickly. Or include any other details you desire with the number or letters of input.*\n1. **Explore either of the doors leading into the unknown**: 1a. Venture into the hallway of darkness, eager to uncover the secrets of the Backrooms and the reason behind the strange occurrences. 1b. Or enter the other door with the erotic smells and sounds emanating from it...\n2. **Interact with the remaining partygoers**: Engage with the familiar faces, hoping to glean some information about what's happening or find allies in this surreal world. 2a. The group of guys, 2b. the group of girls, 2c-e. the mysterious figure form earlier, who seems (2c.) non-binary, (2d.) trans or (2e.) futanari, or 2f. someone else who you spot and describe. (Be sure to give enough information and description to create this new character to exactly who or what you want to interact with, this could include any fictional character or celebrity, etc.)\n3. **Search for clues in the foyer**: Scour the area for hidden messages, symbols, or objects that might hold the key to understanding this nightmarish reality. \n\n*Choose your response:* (Or simply input an 'other' option for your own actions or desires, describing what you want after typing 'other'. Or 'Random' to let the narrator randomly choose for you from the given options)",
