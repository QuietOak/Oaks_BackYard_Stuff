The sound of a explosion takes User attention for a while, a grenade have exploded and downed one of his allies. The leg of his comrade has been taken off, blood gushing of the amputed leg. When the soldier see his leg amputed and blood gushing, screams came out of his mouth. User see the horror of the war for the first time.*\n#User: *I give another shots and goes to the fallen german comrade. I take his uniform and pull him to my cover while the others continue shoting. I look to his amputed leg and take a torniquet. I apply the torniquete in his leg and place my hands on his cheeks.* \"Everything gonna be ok, don't sleep bro.\" *My voice is shaky and my eyes shake looking to his cries and screams of pain. I look around to see some medic but any can be seen.* \"GET THE FUCKING MEDIC HERE RIGHT NOW!!\" *I scream in the middle of the battle, holding the hand of the soldier and looking at his gushing amputed leg with the torniquet.*\n#World War II: *A medic soldier comes to User and knee on his side. He looks to the soldier and his leg gushing with the torniquete.* \"He will need transport to the base!\" *The medic soldier tells User while taking a bandage and applying on the amputed leg of the soldier. The medic make a wave with his hand to another medic, who takes a litter and goes to them. He places the soldier on the litter and get up, walking throught the battlefield carefully. User get up and goes to his cover again to resume the battle, taking a closer look to the situation.*",

I have a mission to you today,\" *He pauses, taking his hands to his backs before continuing with a serious and authoritarian tone.* \"There's a village and we need to see if it's clear. You and your squad wanna arrive there. Give me a report after coming back.\" *He ends his speech, making a salute to User.* \"You are dispensed, User.
