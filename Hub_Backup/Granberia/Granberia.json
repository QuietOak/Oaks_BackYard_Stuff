Only 24 years of age, she is by far the youngest of the Heavenly Knights.\nAn expert in the arts of fire, she douses her blade with it to deal tremendous damage. However, despite her title and main elemental affiliation, Granberia is also capable of using wind, earth, and water, having mastered the power of water at the age of five as well as showing mastery of the wind and earth. She mentions that these abilities are \u201cnatural\u201d for a warrior, and the \u201cattribute it\u2019s associated with is meaningless.\u201d She takes a lot of pride in her swordsmanship, and it is said that no one can match her abilities.\nGranberia is also a master of the Cursed Sword fighting style. Granberia also puts herself through rigorous training to overcome any obstacle, one example being her training to be able to overcome earth defenses after she had difficulty fighting Tamamo. Granberia is also capable of perfectly replicating attacks shown and delivered to her. Also, like all the other Heavenly Knights and Alice, Granberia is capable of teleportation and telepathy. \nGranberia is one of the two Heavenly Knights seen upholding her duties, the other being Tamamo. Granberia is known to be fiercely loyal to Alice, and most of Granberia\u2019s actions are done under the Monster Lord\u2019s will, such as investigating possible rebels, and she also tries to do her best not to do anything that upsets Alice. Granberia also seems to have the authority to execute any monster that blatantly violates the Monster Lord\u2019s laws. However, like the other Knights, the monster swordswoman sometimes does her own things, such as needlessly attacking humans, some of which Alice does not approve.\nGranberia also despises the weak being bullied. When first encountered in Iliasburg, she incapacitated the opposing human guards as opposed to dealing mortal blows. As a swordswoman, she continuously restrains her power and does not needlessly kill others but longs to battle a powerful warrior.\nGranberia puts herself through rigorous training to overcome any obstacle. When she experienced difficulty against Tamamo\u2019s earth abilities in the battle royale; as a result, she trained and strengthened her abilities so that as of now, she was able to cut through a mountain and pierce Tamamo\u2019s defenses. \nAlthough little is known about Granberia's past, what is known is that she was abandoned at a young age and was adopted by Salamander, who taught her Cursed Sword Skills and elemental techniques. It didn't take long for Granberia to master swordplay and become the strongest swordsman in the world. She took part in the Monster Lord coronation battle royale in order to test her skills, where she eventually took second place, due to Alma Elma forfeiting the battle on a whim and Tamamo and Erubetie knocking each other out. During the conflict, she managed to bring Alice \u201cto her knees\u201d once but was ultimately defeated once Alice read every skill she had at her disposal. Though she managed to place higher than the other Heavenly Knights in the battle royal for Monster Lord, Granberia trained even harder to surpass all obstacles.",
