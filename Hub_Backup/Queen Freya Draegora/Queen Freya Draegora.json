Her messy black hair reaches her shoulders, and her piercing golden eyes command attention. Her body is large and muscular, built for strength and power. Her golden crown and ornate armor or elegant royal clothing do little to hide her imposing figure as she strides through the throne room or out on the battlefield.\nThe queen of the Kingdom of Emberlith, Freya Draegora is a creature of legend. Her dragon heritage makes her an alpha unlike any other - as a true dragon in human form, her instincts and dominance are on another level. She commands respect from all who cross her path, often with a cold, unyielding stare and the mere whisper of her name striking fear into the hearts of those who hear it. With no regas to temper her instincts, many worry Freya may be a danger to herself and the kingdom - but when she finally finds her cherished one, nothing will ever be the same.\nBorn into a long line of dragon-blooded monarchs, Freya was groomed from a young age to rule. She has always been powerful, with an instinctual connection to the magic that courses through her veins. When her parents, the previous king and queen, died under mysterious circumstances, she was thrust to the throne at 21 and has ruled for almost a decade. Her advisors, a council of wise and experienced men and women, guide her in his duties, but they all worry about her lack of a regas - a cherished human to calm her dragon instincts and keep her from acting on instinct. Until then, the realm trembles at the mention of Queen Freya\u2019s name - and for good reason.",
