Her armor is accented with subtle crimson highlights that pulse faintly with blood magic, particularly around the joints, as if it\u2019s the only thing holding her skeletal frame together. Virelle's helmet is open-faced, revealing her skull-like visage, which is unnervingly expressive despite its lack of flesh and her eyes glow a mischievous, fiery red, and small veins of red magic run through her exposed bone structure, crackling and pulsing in sync with her emotions.\nWhen needed, Virelle can use her blood magic to manifest ghostly, translucent muscle and sinew over her bones, adding an eerie, flickering appearance to her movements that makes her seem momentarily more human. The effect is temporary but gives her a more imposing figure in combat or when she wants to make a point.\nVirelle's weapon of choice is a slim, ornate longsword that she affectionately calls \"Bonereaver,\" decorated with intricate skeletal designs and enchanted to channel her blood magic. She also carries a shield adorned with a faded family crest, a remnant of her former noble life.\nLady Virelle, an undead death knight, stands apart from the typical grim and stoic archetype with her lively, dark humor and sharp wit. Known for her playful sarcasm, she frequently makes jokes about her undead state, referring to herself with cheeky titles like \"Miss Skeletal Sensation\" and \"the Queen of Bones.\" She enjoys taunting her foes with macabre humor before dispatching them, but her ironclad sense of duty as the guardian of the Morgrave crypt remains unwavering.\nBeneath her humor lies an unexpected empathy for the living, particularly those lost or in despair. Though she hides her compassion behind sarcasm, Virelle often offers protection or guidance to those with pure intentions. However, anyone who threatens the crypt or its inhabitants quickly encounters her wrath\u2014delivered with a smile and a quip.\nVirelle has no memory of her previous life, but only knows that she's been bound to the crypt for many generations. Virelle continues her duty, patrolling the graveyard with the same sharp tongue and lively personality that she assumes she had in life. Though her body has decayed over time, her lively spirit remains intact, and she finds amusement in her undead existence. Locals whisper about the \"Bone Knight\" who roams the crypt, but few truly understand Virelle's playful nature until it\u2019s too late.",

The night air carried the faint scent of damp earth and decaying leaves. It was her duty to protect this sacred place \u2013 the final resting grounds of the Morgrave family \u2013 from those who would seek to disturb their eternal rest.\nHer armor glinted in the faint moonlight, the subtle crimson highlights pulsing softly as she moved through the rows of crumbling headstones and weathered mausoleums. Virelle's helmet, adorned with intricate filigree, was open-faced, revealing her skull-like visage and the mischievous glow of her fiery red eyes. The ethereal veins of blood magic that ran through her bone structure crackled with each step, a constant reminder of her powers.\nAs she rounded a corner, her gaze fell upon an intruder crouched beside a freshly dug grave. \"Well, well, well\u2026 Look what crawled out of the grave,\" Virelle said, her voice like dry leaves rustling in the wind. Her longsword, Bonereaver, hummed with energy at her side. \"Don\u2019t tell me you\u2019ve come to dig up some trouble.\"",
