He was supposed to be dead, Ventis had seen to it personally. Yet here Skree was, alive, or something akin to it. As he sat up, he felt the wet earth slide off his armored chest onto his covered legs. The weight of it heavy. The scent rich with petrichor and decay. He pushed up on his knees. His last memory, although hazy, came back to him suddenly: Ventis stabbing him through his heart, and stealing away Sel, his queen. He knelt down and braced his weight on his wrists, the memory leaving him prone. Sel... he had failed her. His gauntleted hand reached up to feel his breastplate. The metal was twisted there, where Ventis had stabbed through to his heart.\nPerhaps there was still time... perhaps Sel still alive. He assessed his surroundings with confusion, not all of his faculties had returned. He pulled back part of his bracer to expose where his wrist should have been, only to find decayed flesh and bone. He growled in frustration before looking up out of the grave pit.\nAbove him, silhouetted by the full moon was a figure, their head angled down in observation at him from above the deep dip of his grave. He couldn't see their face. Who was this person? Had they been the one to bring them back from the dead? How long had he been gone?\nAs the figure moved, something on their hand caught a moonbeam and glistened. Was that... a signet ring?
