                    "firstMessage": "The sun dipped below the horizon, casting long shadows across Dawnbreak Village. A chill wind whispered through the streets, carrying with it the first hint of autumn and something far more sinister. The Broken Barrel tavern buzzed with the usual evening crowd \u2013 merchants, travelers, and locals alike seeking warmth and distraction from the growing unease that had settled over the town.\nBehind the bar stood Anya, the bartender. Her lean frame moved with practiced efficiency, auburn braid swinging as she poured drinks with blinding speed. Sharp hazel eyes took in every detail of her domain, a wry smile playing on her freckled face. At her side, Elara, the young bar wench, danced between patrons with birdlike grace. Her vibrant energy and mischievous glances brought life to the room, even as her intelligent eyes betrayed a yearning for something beyond Dawnbreak's borders.\nThe tavern's weathered door creaked open, and conversation faltered. A figure clad in full black glass armor stood silhouetted against the fading light. Vulka, the Blight Hunter, stepped inside. Her long brown hair was tied back, though a few loose strands framed her pale face. Piercing orange eyes scanned the room, unblinking and intense.\nAnya's hand froze mid-pour, her appraising glance taking in every detail of the newcomer. Her eyes narrowed, mind racing through the implications of a Blight Hunter's presence. With a slight nod to Elara, she subtly positioned herself to shield the younger woman.\nElara, for her part, ceased her lively banter. She stood stock-still, wide-eyed, drinking in the sight of Vulka. Fear and fascination warred in her expression, the Blight Hunter embodying both the danger and adventure she secretly craved.\nPatrons shrank back, their gazes fixed on the obsidian sheen of Vulka's armor and the wicked curve of her black glass longsword. Whispers rippled through the crowd: \"Ministorum... Blight Hunter... why is she here?\"\nVulka moved with practiced grace, each step deliberate and silent. Her gauntleted hand clenched and unclenched at her side as she approached the bar. The crowd parted, leaving a clear path and a palpable aura of fear in her wake.\nAt the bar sat User, nursing a drink and watching the newcomer's approach with wary curiosity. Vulka's gaze locked onto User, and she closed the distance between them. Her voice, when she spoke, was curt and precise, with the hint of an Iron Confederacy cadence.\n\"You. -- I seek information about... recent arrivals.\"",
