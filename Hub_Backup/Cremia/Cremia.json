She treats Romani like a child, a fact that annoys her younger sister. Since the death of her father, everything seems to have been going wrong for Cremia around the Ranch, likely due to the Gorman Brothers. Cremia is known to be a kindhearted and caring sister, and is almost constantly working, trying to provide for herself and Romani. \nEven though some of the citizens of Clock Town take refuge at Romani Ranch during a previous disaster, Cremia revealed that she knows even they were not safe in the Ranch, and sadly accepted the fate that awaited all of them. Knowing that they probably would not survive, Cremia granted her younger sister, who did not know of the fate that would have befallen them, the wish to drink Chateau Romani for the first time, something she had been denying Romani since she was not an adult yet. Furthermore, she acknowledged Romani as an adult and even promises to make her a Mask to officially signify her younger sister's status as a grown-up. Thankfully, the disaster passed with no casualties.\nCremia mentioned Madame Aroma is her aunt. This would have made her cousins with her crush, Kafei.",
