Nonetheless, Geese recruited Mr. Big, and he quickly rose through the ranks to become Geese's right-hand man. While Geese was out of town on business, he left Mr. Big in charge.

Unfortunately, the plan backfired when Ryo Sakazaki and Robert Garcia fought their way through South Town to rescue her and find Takuma, leaving Mr. Big defeated.

Ideally, a user can excel at both offensive and defensive movements, making them an all-powerful being of strength. The style encourages the users to use their \"ki\" to extend throughout their body and precisely concentrate the force into their strikes, creating a powerful result with enough practice.\nKyokugen Karate is described as a deadly martial art that can only be taught with a mind that focuses on self-defense. It therefore limits the amount of users for the more advanced techniques, as Takuma needs to hand select his disciples. \nThere are at least four known dojos.

Knowing that they needed more training to confront Geese, the brothers made an oath to spend a decade to fine tune their martial arts before trying to avenge their father. Unlike his brother Andy, who left South Town to train in Japan, Terry chose to wander in his home country, combining the skills learned from his father, his father's mentor Tung Fu Rue, and abilities gained from the streets. A decade later, the crime lord Geese Howard organized a tournament, dubbed The King of Fighters. Terry, Andy and Muay Thai Kickboxing champion Joe Higashi would enter with the purpose of facing Geese. The battle that followed would eventually see Terry defeating Geese, and for some time, it was thought that Geese perished in the battle."

During his time in Japan, Andy learned the Shiranui-ryuu Ninjutsu (Shiranui Style Ninja Technique) and a form of empty-handed combat called Koppouken by Hanzo Shiranui. A decade after Jeff's death, Andy returned America, specifically to South Town, where he reunited with Terry.

She is a strong believer of innovation and trends, constantly finding ways to improve herself through change. She is often arguing with her father, Takuma, and brother, Ryo, over matters regarding her newfound sense of independence.\nAs a child, Takuma dedicated more time training Ryo to be next family heir rather than raising Yuri. When she was six years old, her mother died in a tragic car accident. Sensing his family was being targeted, their father leaves in order to protect them. With the loss of both parents, she becomes fearful and heavily dependent on Ryo for the rest of their childhood. When she first meets Robert, she does not trust him but eventually warms up to him.\nWhen she was 17, Yuri was kidnapped by Mr. Big on behalf of Geese Howard as part of a ploy to blackmail her father when he began to show signs of reluctance and resistance to continue doing their dirty work. Ryo and Robert search South Town to find her whereabouts and rescue her. While held hostage, she finds out the identity of Mr. Karate. When Ryo defeats her captors, she reveals it to her brother and the family is reunited. In order to protect herself in the future, Takuma teaches her how to fight much to Ryo and Robert's chagrin. He trained Yuri in secret, but only taught her enough to defend herself.\nYuri, now 20 years old and confident in her fighting prowess, decides to enter the KOF tournament, but is denied to enter by her brother. She meets Mai by chance, and both of them are frustrated that they couldn't enter KOF with who they wanted to (Ryo and Andy respectively). Mai then remembers her \"soul sister\" she met in England named King. Rushing over to England, King agrees to enter KOF with them as the Women Fighters Team, representing England.\nYuri is 168 cm & 50 kg. Her measurements are B82-W56-H80 cm.
