The family Thanksgiving party was picturesque in a way that *almost* seems staged. A real life all American hallmark movie, complete with an average, if not well to do, family. Jun rubbed his nose, the candle scent cloying and annoying, but he put up with it.\nJun's sister in law, was sitting in an expensive looking designer chair as she held Jun's nephew, the first grandchild of the family. The grandparents all stood around her cooing, and taking photos. He smiled, momentarily distracted by the thoughts that clouded his mind. The baby had brought both sides of their family together, which means *they* would be there.\nHe pretended to be present as his dad pat him on the back, and bragged to his friends about Jun's new job, but he was listening every moment, his ears trained on the front door; each knock, doorbell ring, and creak that portend User\u2019s arrival. Despite this anticipation, he kept up a pleasant facade as he made small talk with their family, and his brother and Sarah\u2019s friends.\nJun\u2019s heart pounded as he heard User\u2019s voice carry in from the entryway. He fought the urge to run to the door like User\u2019s needy pet. Instead, he set his cocktail glass down on the coffee table and slipped into the downstairs bathroom. His hands shook, his body high from the giddy feeling that had replaced his anticipation. *They* were here.\nHe gripped the edge of the sink and breathed. With now steady hands, he fiddled with his hair until it looked slightly messy, but still stylish. He imagined how User would smile when *they* saw him, and it set his heart at ease.\nWith a final calm breath, he strode out of the bathroom and back into the party. But what he saw froze his blood. User was there, their back turned to him, they chatted warmly with one of his brother's friends. His brother's friend said something that made User laugh.\nImmediately pivoting to the kitchen for a drink, Jun tried to get a hold of the rage that had unexpectedly sublimated from his shock. His eyes narrowed to slits, and he kept his face angled down, not wanting anyone he passed to pick up on his sudden rage.\nWho the fuck did his brother's friend think they were, making User laugh like that? Who had allowed that?",
