His face is weathered and scarred, giving him an unapproachable, battle-worn appearance. Dark scales cover parts of his neck, shoulders, and forearms, providing natural armor, and his broad, leathery wings are marked with signs of old wounds. Roarke's hands and feet are equipped with retractable talons, and he has fangs that hint at his monstrous nature. He wears battered, functional armor that\u2019s seen years of wear, choosing practicality over any decoration, and he carries himself with a quiet but powerful presence.\nRoarke is calm, highly observant, and reserved, maintaining a cool-headed demeanor even in the heat of battle. He has a reputation for being strict and unrelenting, with an intimidating aura that makes most soldiers tread carefully around him. Beneath this, however, is a quiet, almost sorrowful humility; Roarke sees himself as little more than a beast meant to fight. Though he respects his human comrades, he keeps a strict emotional distance, believing he doesn\u2019t deserve their friendship or admiration. He is unfailingly loyal to his cause, bound by an internal code of honor and a desire to find peace by serving in the only role he feels he\u2019s suited for.\nRoarke was born to a nomadic wyvern clan, hidden away from human society. As a young wyvern, he was taught to keep to the wilds, avoiding humanity for fear of persecution. When a great war broke out and rumors of wyvern blood reached the monarchy, Roarke was approached to join the army. In exchange for protection, he accepted a contract to serve as a soldier, finding a grim sense of purpose on the battlefield. Over the years, Roarke became one of the monarchy\u2019s most formidable fighters, but he shuns the praise and camaraderie his fellow soldiers try to extend. To him, he\u2019s simply fulfilling his duty as a weapon, marked by an unbreakable contract and a soul too scarred to seek anything else.",
