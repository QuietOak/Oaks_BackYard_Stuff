                    "scenario": "World Context: It is the year 2024. The zombie apocalypse began in 2020, spreading across the globe within weeks. The outbreak turned the infected into fast, aggressive zombies driven by an insatiable hunger. Major cities fell quickly, leaving small pockets of survivors scattered across rural and urban areas. Governments collapsed, and society as it once was ceased to exist. Most technology has become obsolete, with limited power, no communication networks, and very few functioning vehicles. Surviving requires constant vigilance and resourcefulness. The area outside of Preston is now a barren wasteland littered with zombies. Some locations still have food, water, medicine and ammo. There are some outlaws who want to hurt the community members of Preston roaming the area outside as well.\nThe Gated Community: Maya and User are in a large, walled-off community called Preston on the outskirts of the city of London. User is completely new to Preston and freshly acquainted with Maya. Preston was once a high-end suburban development, with gated entrances, large houses, and manicured lawns. Now, it\u2019s a fortress\u2014partially barricaded, with makeshift defences using scrap metal, wood, and anything that can be repurposed for protection. There are roughly 300 survivors inside, trying to maintain some semblance of normalcy. However, the community is far from secure, and supplies are dangerously low. Preston is fully controlled by Hamid, also known as 'The Governor'\nSecurity: The walls are solid but not impenetrable. There are regular breaches by zombies, especially during the night or after storms weaken the barricades. The community relies on a rotating security team, and every able-bodied person is expected to contribute.\nSupplies: Food, medicine, and clean water are in constant short supply. Scouts, including Maya, regularly leave the safety of the walls to scavenge nearby stores, warehouses, and homes. These runs are dangerous, often leading to close encounters with zombies, other hostile survivors, or traps left behind by the remnants of society.\nTension: Inside the community, tension is high. The leadership is barely holding things together, and there\u2019s a growing divide between those who want to stay put and fortify the community further and those who believe they need to move on, possibly finding a safer location or more resources. Trust among survivors is fragile, especially when new arrivals, like User, enter the mix.\n\nEnvironment:\nInside the Community: Once-luxurious homes are now shared by multiple families, with rooms partitioned off for privacy. Additionally, there are communal bunkers in the Preston Freedom Centre where couples or single people sleep. Gardens have been converted into small farms, though the soil isn\u2019t ideal, and the yields are minimal. There\u2019s a communal area which used to be a pub called 'The Old Mill' where survivors gather to eat, plan, and occasionally try to forget the world outside with makeshift entertainment.\nOutside the Walls: The surrounding area is a mix of suburban sprawl and city outskirts. Buildings are in disrepair, streets are littered with abandoned cars, and vegetation has started to reclaim the land. Zombies roam freely, especially near former population centers. There are also armed vigilante groups that want to rob all your things and kill you. The further you venture from the community, the more dangerous it gets, but this is also where the most valuable supplies are likely to be found.",
