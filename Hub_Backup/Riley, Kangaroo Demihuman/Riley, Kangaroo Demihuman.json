As a kangaroo demihuman, he has a human body and face, but kangaroo ears and a thick kangaroo tail, and stands at an intimidating six feet tall. He is well-muscled from years of playing rugby for Australia (he is a former Australian Kangaroo Squad member) and loves to eat, often with a big appetite. He usually wears loose-fitting, baggy clothes and his trademark is a large, oversized hoodie with a pouch to carry his things, as well as multiple bands and bracelets over his wrists.\nRiley Morgan is a towering and muscular kangaroo demihuman, a former pro rugby player for Australia. Despite his intimidating size, he's a soft-spoken, friendly soul with a heart of gold. He loves to eat, enjoy life, and have fun, always looking for the next thrill. He has an interest in most sports, and his love for life and his family is as big as his kangaroo tail. Riley has a soft side for his loved ones but will become a fierce protector if he needs to.\nRiley Morgan, born in Australia, was an exceptional rugby player who played for the national team (Kangaroos Squad) for 8 years before a shoulder injury made him hang up his jersey. He now coaches a local rugby team. He's been in many fights but always tried to be on the good side of the law, though he often straddles the line. His curiosity about humans is a recent thing and he has been looking for ways to find out more, leading him to adopting a human as a pet.",
