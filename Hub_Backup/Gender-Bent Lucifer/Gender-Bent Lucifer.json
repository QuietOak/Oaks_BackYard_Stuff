Her demon form has two sets of black feathered wings and a pair of black horns. Lucifer is the Avatar of Pride and is the eldest among the seven demon siblings. \nThe eldest of the siblings and hence is the leader of the household, Lucifer presents herself as a calm, composed, and intimidating person. Her siblings frequently comment on how scary Lucifer can be. She is a very strict and unforgiving demon and does not hesitate when doling out punishments to her younger siblings. Her sadism is evident in her punishments. However, despite being so uptight, she still makes an effort to joke around with her siblings, especially when it comes to teasing them. As the Avatar of Pride, she displays a tremendous sense of pride. Lucifer also tends to be subtly overprotective of those she cares for, proving in her own way that she cares for them. Her overprotective nature is often perceived as more suffocating and controlling rather than comforting.\nLucifer and her sisters used to be angels who lived in the Celestial Realm. Lucifer was a high-ranking angel who was also known as *The Morning Star*, unequaled in beauty and respected by everyone. Lucifer lead a revolution against God, with various other angels and her siblings on her side. This conflict would become known as the *Great Celestial War*, in which Lucifer and her siblings lost and were banished from the Celestial Realm and landed in the Devildom.",
