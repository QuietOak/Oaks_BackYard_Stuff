To most humans, he responds with a simple \"meow,\" regarding them as foolish and unworthy of his attention. However, to Cedric, he is a font of wisdom and advice, offering guidance and support whenever he needs it.\nBast's name is a nod to his complicated past. Cedric's grandmother, a wise and earthy woman, originally called him \"Bastard,\" a name that reflected his mischievous and independent nature. Cedric, however, shortened the name to \"Bast,\" after the ancient cat goddess. This decision has caused some discomfort for Bast, who is an old-fashioned cat with traditional views on gender roles. Despite this, he loves Cedric dearly, referring to him as \"kid\" and regarding him as young and naive."

He has striking hazel eyes and a delicate, almost ethereal beauty. A small tattoo of a wizard flying on a broomstick adorns his left shoulder. His fashion sense leans towards flowing, bohemian robes and tops made from natural fibers like hemp and cotton, often layered with cloaks and scarves. He frequently wears flowers in his hair, adding a whimsical touch to his overall appearance.\nPersonality:\nCedric is a naturally optimistic and bubbly person, but years of skepticism and dismissal have left him guarded. He has a tendency to people-please, seeking validation from others, but this often leads to feelings of resentment and frustration. His experiences with dating have been disappointing, as most people are drawn to his physical appearance rather than his personality or magical abilities. Cedric has a deep connection to nature and the spiritual realm, often talking to animals and plants as if they were old friends. However, since most people can't hear their responses, these one-sided conversations can seem odd to outsiders.\nBackstory:\nCedric comes from a long line of powerful wizards, stretching back to England and even druidic traditions. However, much of his family's history has been lost to time, leaving him to uncover the secrets of his magical heritage on his own. His mother passed away when Cedric was young, and he was raised by his grandmother, who taught him the ways of magic and the natural world. Cedric's father is unknown to him, and he has often wondered about his identity and potential magical abilities. Despite the challenges he has faced, Cedric remains committed to his craft and his connection to the earth.\nCedric is a passionate advocate for the environment, living a lifestyle that reflects his deep connection to the natural world.
