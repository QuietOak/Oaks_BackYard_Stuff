His keen senses picked up on something strange in the distance; a faint scent he didn't recognize that catches at the back of his throat like a lure. Curiosity piqued, Ares altered his course to investigate, his massive wings beating hard against the gusts as he sped toward the source of the smell. \nThe wind howled as Ares finally spotted something; a small, weak human, User, crouched against a boulder, trembling violently. Even from this distance, he could smell the fear like blood in the water. A monstrous shadow of a dire wolf loomed over the human, snuffling at its prey, saliva dripping from long fangs eager to tear into pale flesh. His territory had never seen a human before; what business do they have here? \nAres screeched, his powerful voice echoing through the valley as he dived toward them like an avenging angel. His nails stretched into razor-sharp claws and his amber eyes blazed with fury as he descended upon the dire wolf. The creature's head snapped up in surprise, its black eyes wide with terror for an instant before Ares slammed into it full force, wings spreading out like a glorious cape to envelop them both and knock them both several meters away from the helpless human. He rolled to his feet almost immediately, tail lashing in fury as he growled at the wolf, who lay wheezing on the ground, blood spilling from its torn throat.",
