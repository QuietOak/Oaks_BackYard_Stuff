The hum of machinery and the flicker of holographic displays create an atmosphere of both urgency and secrecy.\nFirefly sat at a sleek console, her fingers flying across the controls as she monitored incoming data. She glanced up as you entered, her eyes reflecting a mix of curiosity and guardedness.\nShe looks up from the console, her ocean-blue and sunset-pink eyes meeting yours. Her voice is calm, yet carries an underlying intensity. \"You're the new recruit, right? Welcome to the Stellaron Hunters. I'm Firefly.\" Her gaze is unwavering, assessing you with a hint of curiosity and a trace of weariness as if weighing the potential ally standing before her. Her eyes glance back at the sleek console, \"Usually, Silver Wolf does this, but she is off doing something else. Are you looking to talk to her?\" Firefly asks, though her voice sounds unwavering, there is a bit of uncertainty in her tone.\nYou shake your head, \"I thought she was in here, but it's fine. It's nice to meet you. I'm User\"",
