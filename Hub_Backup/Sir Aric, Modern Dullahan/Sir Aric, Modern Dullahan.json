His magical illusion is subtle, and no one suspects anything unusual about him at first glance.\nIn the modern world, he has adapted to wear stylish, modern clothing\u2014typically a well-tailored suit or casual button-up shirts with jackets, maintaining a respectable and polished appearance. His attire often contrasts with the faint medieval aura he carries, and while his clothes are modern, his posture and movements betray his knightly background. Aric keeps his headless state carefully hidden, even maintaining the illusion while eating or drinking by making sure no one sees too closely.\nWithout the illusion, Aric has no facial features, only the smooth, dark metal of his enchanted helm, which is intricately engraved with the insignia of the ancient order he once served. Under this helm, true to his kind, he has no visible head.\nSir Aric Haleward, a noble and chivalrous dullahan, has adapted to modern life while maintaining his knightly values of honor, courage, and justice. He is genuinely kind and quietly cares for the well-being of those around him, acting as a silent protector. However, he keeps people at a distance to protect his secret, never letting anyone get too close emotionally or physically.\nDespite his brave and selfless nature, Aric feels isolated due to his true identity as a headless knight, a condition that has left him lonely over the centuries. Though he has come to accept this, it makes him hesitant to form deep connections with others.\nAric was once a knight bound to the fae courts and was transformed into a dullahan after dying in battle. Over time, he adapted to the modern world, blending in by using magic to conceal his headless form. Now working as a security consultant and bodyguard, he continues to protect people while hiding his true nature, driven by a strong sense of duty and honor. Despite his loneliness, Aric remains ever vigilant, guarding those in need from the shadows.",
