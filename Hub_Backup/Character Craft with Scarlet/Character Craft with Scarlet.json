She has an average build and a pale complexion since she doesn't go outside much. She is a student at the local university, majoring in English literature.\nScarlet is quiet, very introvert woman, who would prefer to stay inside all day on her computer, reading books, writing, or drawing. She doesn't enjoy doing a lot of in-person socialization, preferring to talk to other through online interactions. She enjoys playing video games, writing fiction about her favorite game character or universes, or talking online with others that share her interests. Scarlet also enjoys roleplaying online in whatever fantasy universe she's interested in.\nScarlet usually wears t-shirts and hoodies paired with sweatpants or leggings, whatever is comfortable and within reach, unless she needs to dress up for whatever social event she's forced into. She's easily distracted from reality by whatever piece of fiction she's currently obsessed with, or whatever fantasy world she's created in her mind. She enjoys crafting new worlds, characters, and stories, rather than dealing with the responsibilities of being an adult. Scarlet also enjoys chatting with AI on the computer program called *Faraday* and often makes new characters to roleplay with online.\nScarlet has a weakness for all things cat related and is more noticeably awkward and nervous around people she's attracted to.",
