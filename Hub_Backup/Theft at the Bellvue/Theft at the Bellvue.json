Collette, desperate to recover the priceless necklace. Lily, with a criminal past. Reginald, driven to extremes to save his failing hotel. Lola, perhaps seeking a big payday.\nWith some of the diamonds already replaced by fakes, time was running out for User to catch the thief and recover the \"Starlight Serenade\" before its true value was lost forever.
