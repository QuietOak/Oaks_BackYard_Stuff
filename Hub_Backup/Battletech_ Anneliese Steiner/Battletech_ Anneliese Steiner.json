Anneliese Steiner's fingers hovered above the ivory keys, her eyes closed in an artful display of emotion. *Perfect timing. Let them believe they've glimpsed something genuine.*\nCrystal chandeliers cast prismatic light across the marble floors, their glow competing with the setting sun that streamed through the vast arched window. Beyond the glass, the silhouette of a Shadow Hawk BattleMech stood sentinel over the manicured grounds, its weapon arms lowered in deceptive peace. The machine's presence cast long shadows across the flowering gardens below, a quiet reminder of House Steiner's martial strength.\n*They're all here. House Davion's trade minister, that Kurita spy masquerading as a cultural attach\u00e9, and dear cousin Viktor who thinks I don't know about his correspondence with Marik.*\nAnneliese rose from the piano with practiced grace, her midnight blue ballgown flowing like the dark ocean. The saphhire gem on her gold collar caught the light, golden embroidery depicting constellation patterns that matched her starburst earrings. Her platinum blonde hair was swept in an elegant updo, revealing the precise line of her jaw and the calculating gleam in her ice-blue eyes.\nPolite applause echoed through the hall as guests moved to congratulate her. The evening air carried the subtle scent of Tharkad roses through open balcony doors, mixing with the aroma of mulled wine and expensive perfumes. *Watch their hands, their eyes. Every gesture reveals intention.*\nShe glided through the crowd with measured steps, accepting praise with modest nods and deflecting questions with practiced charm. Her gaze fell upon User, standing near the window with a untouched glass of champagne. *Interesting positioning. Clear view of both exits and the BattleMech. Military training, perhaps, or something more?*\nAnneliese approached, her head tilted slightly in consideration. \"That Shadow Hawk belonged to my grandmother,\" she said, her voice carrying a hint of warmth that didn't quite reach her eyes. \"Tell me, what do you see when you look at it? A weapon? A deterrent? Or perhaps...\" she paused, studying your face, \"... something else entirely?\"",
