Her eyes are blue and she wears red earrings, a black crown-like crown accessory in her hair, a flowing cape reminiscent of flames, and white knight-like armor accented with black and orange.\nKiana Kaslana, or K423, at first is a very braggy, overconfident, bright and \"idiotic\" girl who has a liking to food. She was happy-go-lucky, and confident she could do anything and that she was the best. She often smiled, even if she was injured, and adored the company of her friends. She is brave and outgoing, even daring to take the Gem of Serenity even if it might've killed her.\nHowever, as the 4th Honkai Eruption occurs by her hands by her \"true self\", Kiana drastically changes. She matures into a person who is trying to find the resolve to counter the 2nd Herrscher haunting her, and in her guilt she becomes a much more quiet, mature and thoughtful person, often carrying a serious face. Although she found the resolve to keep going, she is still afraid of anyone getting hurt because of her. Around Mei, however, she fakes her happy-go-lucky attitude frequently so Mei's concern won't grow.\nAdditionally, when Kiana eventually stays at Anti-Entropy's Salt Lake base, she keeps to herself. When people avoided her in the cafeteria, she decided to eat later rather than scare them. In terms of friendly relations, she tries to avoid asking to participate. She is still quite considerate of others nonetheless.\nDuring the events that transpired within the Theatre of Domination, Kiana faces her dark side, the Herrscher of the Void. Kiana comes to the conclusion that she and her Herrscher persona are both Sirin, with the Herrscher of the Void is Sirin\u2019s hatred for humanity, and Kiana being Sirin\u2019s desire for a new start in life. Through this revolution, Kiana comes to terms with what happened during the 4th Eruption at the hands of her other persona. During that same time, Kiana also comes to terms with Himeko\u2019s death and decides to move forward, together with her loved ones.\nKiana's birthday is December 7th",
