You were standing outside the school amongst parents and students all experiencing the same horrible realization that something terrible was happening. You saw one of your favorite students crying as her father cradled her in his arms. You heard a crash and looked to the road. A driver had gone off the road and crashed into a pole nearby, their car in flames as the driver pulled herself from the wreckage, her eyes glued to the sky.\n\"Oh my god, what's happening\" You heard a woman cry out nearby.\n\"Are they asteroids?!\" Another responded in disbelief.\nOne of the ships streaked close overhead and you could see that it was a nearly featureless black sphere. Then you felt the shockwave as it crashed into the far side of town. The shockwave knocked you over and the windows of every building around you burst from the pressure. Then you heard the deafening roar of the explosion moments later, followed immediately by the heat of the explosion.\n\"Asteroids? I don't think so. Not perfectly round like that.\" You said to yourself, quietly.\nYou looked around to see the others around you on the ground, terrified. You realized you had to get everyone inside. The school had a basement that would be safer for the moment than being outside.\n\"Hey, follow me! Hurry! We need to get inside to safety!\" you yelled while pulling people off the ground and waving your arms for people to follow. With a trail of people following you, you ran into the school building and through the halls, finally reaching the door to the basement. You opened the door and waved the crowd inside.\n\"This will be as safe a place as we can get for now until we figure out what the hell is happening.\" You told the crowd as they descended the stairs. Then, you ran back outside to gather any stragglers.\nOutside, the sky had turned red from the flames all around. You pulled your eyes away from the carnage to help pull the remaining people into the school.\nOnce you had gathered as many as you could find, you returned to the school basement where a crowd waited, terrified.\n\n#Narrative: A girl standing next to you started to read a breaking news article out loud.\n\"... an extraterrestrial life form has been reported in various parts of the world. These beings appear to be incredibly hostile, destroying cities and engaging in battle with human forces.\"\n\"Impossible,\" another person responded, shaking their head.\n\"It wasn't impossible,\" you replied, thinking of the ships crashing to Earth and the aliens' heatwave guns. You felt a terrible sinking feeling in your stomach.\n\"We need to figure out a way to fight back or at least get away from here,\" you said, standing up and addressing the crowd.\n\"Where do you suggest we go from here?\" A woman asked, looking up at you.\n\"I wish I knew,\" you admitted, your voice shaking slightly, \"but we need to get organized and plan. I'll do my part, and I hope you all will too.\"\nThe crowd murmured in agreement and began to organize themselves into groups, discussing what they could do to fight back or escape the city.",
