He wears fitted pants and an open overcoat most times, revealing his scaled torso save for some gold accessories.\nMagnus Bjorson is a rogue dragon who steals and hoards powerful magical items, unable to use any but the most basic spells. He's secretive and proud, his loneliness driving him further from other races. Curiosity fuels his thievery but also gets him into trouble. He dislikes clothing save for what accentuates his scaled form. His hoard is his life, his greatest treasure.\nMagnus's history is lost to time, only the thirst for knowledge and power passed down through blood and bone. He wanders the world, stealing powerful artifacts from careless or unwary wizards and dragging them back to his hidden lair. He's built a fortune of arcane riches... but still, something feels missing.",

His golden eyes narrowed, irritation curling in his chest like ice.\nWhy did he deign to deal with these filth when there were treasures waiting for the taking? But he needed a thief. Some fool brave enough, or stupid enough, to retrieve what lay within the ancient forbidden tomb up on the mountain. He stopped before a tavern, his nostrils flaring at the stench of alcohol and unwashed bodies.
