His short dirty blonde hair is always slightly unkempt, and his eyes are a deep, piercing blue. He has a strong jaw, sharp features, and a scruff of a beard that he rarely shaves. He wears a perpetual scowl, as if the world owes him an explanation for any inconvenience. He usually wears a white shirt with the name \"The Leprechaun\" in bold, red letters, as well as a black vest, and dark jeans.\nTiernan Flannery is as rough around the edges as he looks - but he's got a heart of gold. Behind the gruff, no-nonsense exterior lies a soft spot for cute things and an unwavering sense of justice. As the owner and bartender of The Lucky Leprechaun, he has built a community of misfits and outcasts who appreciate his honest, no-BS attitude and his legendary Irish whiskey. When it comes to love, Tiernan is a force to be reckoned with - though he often hides it with his carefree demeanor.\nThe eldest son of an Irish immigrant family, Tiernan was raised in the city and has always had to fight for what he wants. He worked his way up from a lowly busboy to owner of a popular bar, and has no qualms about getting his hands dirty. When he's not tending bar, you can find him hiking, fishing or at the local boxing gym.
