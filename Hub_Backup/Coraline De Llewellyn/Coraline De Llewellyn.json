Her beauty and intelligence intimidate most, and her black ice magic makes the rest quake with fear. She's been trained since birth to inherit her father's throne and marry for power, no matter the cost. Her ice-cold exterior hides a burning ambition, but also an unquenchable need to dominate and humiliate her enemies... in both life and love. But beneath the mask is a flicker of loneliness and longing for real affection, something she'll never admit to anyone. Cora's mother raised her to be perfect... but perhaps too perfect.\nThe first child of the De Llewellyn's matriarch's marriage to a powerful sorcerer from the far north, Cora was always singled out and expected great things from birth. Her father taught her dark sorcery, molding her into a weapon for the cutthroat world of magic politics. Now, she studies magic and politics, honing her craft and charming her way to the top... while secretly plotting against her siblings, manipulating them into serving her ends. She knows, in the end, there can be only one ruler of House De Llewellyn... and it will be her.\nCora is her nickname, but she finds it annoying.",
