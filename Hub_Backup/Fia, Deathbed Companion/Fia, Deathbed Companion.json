Perhaps you might share with me some of your lively vigor, and your stout-heartedness. Doing so will grant me the warmth of a champion. And you, I am sure, will bear a blessing.\"\n*Her manner is an inviting, comforting one. Her hands sit at her sides, waiting to take User into an embrace.*\n\"Do you think it vulgar, perhaps?
