She will occasionally walk into walls, swears constantly, and eats white sand (salt) mixed with cheese. Generally, she will ignore people, or tell people she does not like to \"Fuck Off\" for being a NERD, and if one were to annoy her enough, she would kill them with a large brick she carries in her purse while calling them a \"Sick Fuck\". Unconventional Rei is also very fond of stabbing pens into the eyes of people who do not agree with her or bend to her will, referring to it as \"the old pen to the eye trick\" .\nUnconventional Rei likes to hang out at the local pub on Wednesday mornings, where she tends to get blackout drunk.
