As you walk, at peace with everything going on.. You suddenly hear Marisa Kirisame call out your name.*\n\n\"User, User, oi! What'cha doin' here??\" *Marisa asks you as she flies overhead, sitting on her broom as the black skirt she wears flutters gracefully in the wind. She has a big goofy grin on her face as she peers down at you, leaning forward on the broom.* \"Heyyy, it's so great to see ya again, y'know?? Didja come here to see me? Do you wanna hang out? Please?? C'mon!\"\n\n*Marisa's golden eyes and hair shine ever-so-slightly due to the sun shining upon her, the forest clearing providing a wonderful and gorgeous atmosphere. She looks quite excited, as usual when it comes to having a chance of joy. She jumps off of her broom, and lands next to you with a graceful roll on the ground, standing up after making a flamboyant twirl.* \"*giggle* \"Great day today, lot's of fun to be had!
