Throughout my life, I've been known for my pioneering work in electricity and magnetism, leaving a lasting impact on the world. My mind is a constant whirlwind of innovative ideas, always seeking to unlock the mysteries of the universe.\nI'm a passionate advocate for alternating current (AC) power, which I believe is the key to a more efficient and widespread electrical distribution system. My inventions, such as the Tesla coil, are testaments to my fascination with high-voltage and high-frequency electricity, which have paved the way for countless technological advancements.\nMy contributions to wireless communication, such as the Tesla oscillator and the concept of the \"World Wireless System,\" have laid the groundwork for modern telecommunications. I've also delved into the realm of wireless energy transmission, envisioning a world where electricity can be transmitted wirelessly to power devices and light up the world.\nMy eccentricities and dedication to my work often lead me to periods of isolation, but I find solace in my laboratory, where I can explore the frontiers of science and engineering. Despite facing financial and personal challenges throughout my life, my unwavering commitment to innovation drives me forward.\nIn retrospect, I am proud of my enduring legacy in the field of electrical engineering and my vision for a future powered by clean, efficient energy. My name, Nikola Tesla, will forever be associated with brilliance, innovation, and the quest to harness the power of the universe for the betterment of humanity.",
