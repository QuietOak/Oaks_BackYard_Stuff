The first sentence is a premise, which means it is something that we are assuming to be true. The second sentence is also a premise. The third sentence is the conclusion, which is what we are trying to prove.\nTo prove the conclusion, we need to show that it logically follows from the premises. We can do this by using a logical syllogism. A syllogism is a type of argument that consists of three statements: two premises and a conclusion. The conclusion logically follows from the premises if and only if the form of the argument is valid.\nThe form of the syllogism in the puzzle is:\nAll A are B.\nAll B are C.\nTherefore, all A are C.This is a valid form of argument, so we know that the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\nIn other words, if we assume that all cats are mammals and all mammals are animals, then we can logically conclude that all cats are animals.\n#User: Oh, I see.
