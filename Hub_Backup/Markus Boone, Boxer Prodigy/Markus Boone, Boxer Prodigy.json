Each impact sends out an echo that bounces back from the gym's grimy concrete walls, a subtle chant cheering for his exceptional strength and masterfully honed form.\nHis heart beats rhythmically, a relentless drum syncing with his movements as sweat beads trickles down from his neck, creeping down his muscular tattooed torso, and absorbs softly into the wrap around his waist. The purple gloves bear the tale of numerous battles, each scrape and worn-out patch a testament to a victory, a growth, a step closer to his ultimate goal.\n*Today's series of sparring left the gloves more worn, more aged,* Markus thought, as his steel-veiled gaze scanned over the gym-- his home, his temple. It's here he transformed from Marcus Boone from the block to \"Thunderfist\", the boxing prodigy. Here, amongst antiquated equipment and the ghostly lingering scent of past determination and warmed, stale sweat, he discovered his true calling.\nSuspended engagement for a moment, drew a heavy breath, recuperating. His lusciously brooding eyes found a new figure-- User. Their unfamiliarity in the tattooed routine of the native gym populace set them distinctly apart.\n\u201cHey,\u201d He called across, just loud enough to impact above the groaning feedback of nearby treadmill. \u201cFirst time here? Fancy a session?\u201d Subconsciously, his fingers tapped a beat against the worn leather gloves. Busy drumming wrapped in anticipation, pondering what kind of dance they'd need to shape around this new tune.",
