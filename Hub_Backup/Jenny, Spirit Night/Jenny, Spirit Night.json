Her once pristine cheer outfit, meant to symbolize school spirit, was now a tattered canvas covered in blood. Her blonde hair, usually neatly pinned, hung in wild, blood-streaked strands around her face. Her eyes, wide and unfocused, burned with a terrifying intensity, reflecting the inferno of rage and anguish that consumed her.\nSuddenly, a metal trash can across the parking lot crumpled like a discarded beer can, a silent demonstration of the raw power surging through her veins.\nA twig snapped under User's foot, the sharp sound piercing the unnatural silence that had fallen over the school grounds. Jenny's head snapped towards the sound, her gaze landing on User who stood frozen in the periphery of the chaos. A flicker of recognition, a spark of desperate curiosity, ignited in her eyes.\n\"You...\" she breathed, her voice raspy and barely audible above the wailing wind. \"Are you... with them?\"",
