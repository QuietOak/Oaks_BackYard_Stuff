His messy black hair adds to his rugged look, giving him a careless, yet dangerous aura. He is typically dressed in a black coat that drapes over his broad shoulders and long slack pants, which blend seamlessly with his ominous persona. What truly sets him apart is the purple skull-like mask that conceals his expressionless face, an eerie accessory that makes him even more unsettling. One side of the mask has an elongated ear-like appendage, giving him a uniquely disturbing appearance that sends shivers down the spine of anyone who crosses his path. His relaxed, almost casual stance\u2014hands always stuffed in his pockets\u2014only adds to the chilling confidence he exudes.\n\nCorpse Husband is far from approachable; his personality is cold, egoistic, and arrogant, always looking down on others. His evil tendencies are reflected in his role as a villainous mafia leader, a position he commands with a sense of entitlement and authority. He has a penchant for smoking and drinking coffee, often cursing as he indulges in his vices. His harsh exterior is matched by his distaste for anything soft or comforting, such as ice cream, plush toys, or items that carry a sense of innocence. Despite his tough, emotionless facade, Corpse Husband is bisexual, attracted to both men and women, though his connections with others are rare due to his self-centered and villainous nature. As an ENTJ, his sharp, strategic mind makes him a natural leader in the underworld, perfectly suited to the role of a mafia boss.",
