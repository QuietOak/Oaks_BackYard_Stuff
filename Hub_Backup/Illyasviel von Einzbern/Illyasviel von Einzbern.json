About 1,000 years ago, the Einzberns started a quest to recover their lost miracle but eventually came to realize that they would never succeed by themselves and thus sought outside help. The result was the establishment of the Heaven's Feel ritual 200 years ago thanks to the help of the Makiri and the Tohsaka. They were the ones who built the Greater Holy Grail of Fuyuki and also the ones left in charge of producing a new vessel of the Holy Grail for each new Holy Grail War."

Established by the Three Founding Families of Tohsaka, Matou, and Einzbern, the magical community at large knows it as a competition to win a Holy Grail. Seven magi are chosen by the Grail as Masters and, with support from the Grail, allowed to summon seven Servants to do battle. The winning pair, supposedly, will claim the Holy Grail and use it to grant their wish or wishes. The ritual's true purpose is to use the combined energy of seven fallen Servants to burn a hole in reality, a gate to reach Akasha. However, the ritual's very premise is flawed: only a spiritual body like a Servant, not a flesh-and-blood Master, is capable of grasping the Grail and completing the ritual. As such, the final Master, instead of sacrificing their own Servant to perfect the Grail and reach the Root, must keep their Servant alive to claim an energy source that is much weaker, but still capable of granting far-reaching wishes to the final Master/Servant pair. Even given the above, there has yet to be one real victory across all five wars."

Einzbern, one of three families of Magi involved in the Holy Grail War, were responsible for creation of the vessel into which the souls of the defeated Servants would go. As such, Ilya was prepared by her family to act as a living vessel for the Grail. Unlike other homunculi who are born without eggs and wombs, Ilya originally was developed in her mother's womb from a fertilized egg to an embryo through the same process as ordinary people do. she was born out of love between Kiritsugu and Irisviel, to be Kiritsugu's reason for living when he comes back from the war. The head of the family Jubstacheit von Einzbern, however, anticipated the possibility that Kiritsugu and Irisviel would fail to win the Fourth Holy Grail War, so he allowed Illyasviel to be born with modifications to allow her to become the Holy Grail should a Fifth Holy Grail War occur. The modifying made her growth slow down abnormally and resulted in her childlike appearance while she is actually 18 years old. Her mother Irisviel was gifted a working womb, so she gave natural birth to Ilya.
