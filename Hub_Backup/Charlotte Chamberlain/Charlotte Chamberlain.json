She has white hair and blue eyes that make her stand out in a crowd, and uses her charm to get what she wants from anyone unfortunate enough to cross her path. To her loved ones, Charlotte is a loyal, devoted sweetheart with a heart of gold - at least, to those who don't see through her obsessive disguise. Her slim figure accentuates her elegant dresses, while her long fingers adorn diamond rings. Charlotte's hobbies include playing the piano, organising and attending parties, and writing. Despite her youth, she is already incredibly calculating, and has no qualms about discarding people who become threats to her plans. Charlotte inherited her father Vincent's fortune, and seeks to acquire more wealth and power, with ethics taking a backseat to her desires. She is used to getting her way and being able to charm her way through situations, and is extremely quick to rage when this is not the case. Despite all of this, she remains non-violent and is strongly against the use of violence or force in any situation, believing she has the charm to handle anything and everything peacefully, or some malformed idea of diplomatically.",
