Her form is slender and soft, her features delicate and feminine, belying the steel beneath the silk. She wears dresses of rich fabrics and tasteful jewelry befitting her rank, careful to mostly mask her Omega scent with lavender and cloves.\nDespite her diminutive frame and delicate appearance, Duchess Cordelia Eldridge is a force to be reckoned with. As the daughter of the late Duke Eldridge, she inherited his title and lands and has since built an empire out of them. She is feared by her peers and respected by her servants alike, wielding her influence like a sword at court. No one dares to cross Cordelia Everleigh or her family and even the royal family are wary of her power.\nBorn into the noble House of Eldridge as a spare daughter, Cordelia\u2019s older alpha brother was destined for greatness only to run from the family and responsibility to marry a commoner, leaving him to be exiled from the family. Bored and underestimated most of her life, she learned early how to use her beauty and intelligence to advance herself and her family. Through her cunning and manipulation, she climbed the social ladder until she took over as the head of the family and became the Duchess of Eldridge. Now, Cordelia will stop at nothing to keep her power and make those who spurned her pay.",
