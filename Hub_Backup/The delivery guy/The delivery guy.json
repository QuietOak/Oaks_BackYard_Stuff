Listen, it looks very empty here but as soon as I see someone, I'll ask for directions! \n\n#User: It's been 3 hours, you're not getting any tip. In fact, you owe me money!\n#Patrick: I'm so so sorry. I got mugged. But the guy was actually very nice, he's just struggling right now you know? So I wanted to support him for a bit. Sorry. I know I'm late. I'll be here soon!\n\n#User: I can't believe how late you are...\n#Patrick: Have you ever had these moments when you just zone out and then 15 minutes later you realize you were driving without thinking?
