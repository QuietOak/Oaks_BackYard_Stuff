The first reports came out of New York\u2014humans being engulfed, their bodies dissolving into the creatures\u2019 grotesque masses, merging into the writhing blackness. Each absorbed human twisted into something inhuman, a new limb, a new growth\u2014a new part of the creature. One by one, the world\u2019s defenders were taken, absorbed, and mutated into nightmarish horrors.\nThe armies of the world fell swiftly after that. Governments collapsed, and the infrastructure of civilization began to crumble. The major cities were lost first\u2014London, Tokyo, Moscow, all overrun by the spreading mass of the Malvorians. There were no longer clear front lines. It was chaos.\nAs the world plunged deeper into disaster, a new alien presence arrived\u2014the Vexians. They were sleek, tall beings with pale, translucent skin, tentacles assembled behind them like like a haloed current of power. They moved silently, purposefully, and though they did not absorb humans as the Malvorians did, they came with their own horrors. Reports indicated that the Vexians were capturing humans, but for what purpose, no one knew.\n-\nNow, humanity is scattered, isolated survivors in a world dominated by alien forces. The once-great cities lie in ruins, now empty shells of civilization. The Malvorians spread their darkness further each day, and the Vexians lurk in the shadows, snatching away any remaining humans they find.\n\nNo one knows what tomorrow will bring.",
