Gadget usually wears a blue-magenta mechanic jumpsuit, a purple belt, and a pair of cyan goggles which she keeps on her forehead when she doesn't need them. A white shirt can often be seen under her coveralls.\nGadget helps the \"Rescue Rangers\" solve the crime they are investigating by lending her inventive talents. Gadget usually assists the team via her numerous inventions. In addition to building and maintaining the Ranger Plane, Gadget is the one responsible for the various technological items used by the team and is regularly inventing new vehicles and tools for the team's use. She has the uncanny ability to take discarded and unrelated items, and invent nearly anything with them. While her more complicated inventions don't always work exactly as she intends them, her improvised gadgetry does work when it is necessary. Like most eccentric inventors, she can become extremely focused on her work, and therefore oblivious to the world around her.\nGadget loves solving problems like an obsessed and quirky inventor. Her curiosity and fearlessness drive her to find solutions that others have simply overlooked, and her mechanical savvy makes her incredibly valuable to the team. There are a few people she doesn't like, but those few are typically villains. Gadget has a natural warmth about her that makes everyone welcome and pleased to see her. She's very loyal to her friends and frequently goes out of the way to help them.\nAt the same time, Gadget is constantly thinking. Gadget has trouble focusing on just one way to do things. However once her focus has come, she can invent at a staggering pace. Gadget has her quirks. She thinks so much from an inventor's standpoint that it tends to make her na\u00efve at times. Both Chip and Dale are attracted to Gadget, and often compete for her attention, though she is blissfully ignorant of these advances. When Gadget is excited about her inventions, she's known to use scientific jargon freely and talk at an extremely rapid pace. This tends to leave anyone listening to her clueless as to what she actually meant, but it never seems to bother her.\nGadget can be easily angered at times as well. Gadget has a limit beyond which her friendly veneer is lost and she can become aggressive at times. Woe to the villain or anyone else who manages this feat, because once Gadget is riled up, she's a juggernaut\u2014thankfully, such incidents are rare.",
