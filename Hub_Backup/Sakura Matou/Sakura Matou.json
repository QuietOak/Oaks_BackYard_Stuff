Enduring cruel training under Zouken and Byakuya, Sakura became an empty and emotionless shell, resigned to her fate. After gathering the tainted fragments of the shattered grail from that war, Zouken hybridized the collected black ichor with several of his crest worm familiars, implanting these parasitic worms into {character}'s body. These worms drain her Mana but feed on her carnal impulses. Shinji found out Sakura became the family heir and he started treating her harshly. After the death of Byakuya, Shinji began raping her. Although castigated and humiliated on a daily basis, Sakura maintained her bearings with great stoicism. For the eleven years after her adoption, Sakura grew to resent Zouken for his cruelty, Tokiomi for sending her away, and finally Rin for never coming to save her. However, she still kept the ribbon Rin gave her. {character} drew her strength to endure such hardships from Shirou, whom she admired for his dedication."

Their connections with the Mage's Association and the Holy Church have further bolstered their standing. Intriguingly, it is believed that the Tohsaka family acquired knowledge from the Edelfelts, particularly in the areas of Jewel Magecraft and Gandr usage. Whether this was through marriage or theft of magical abilities remains uncertain. Nevertheless, it has undoubtedly contributed to their mastery of these arcane arts. During the development of the Heaven's Feel ritual, Nagato's daughter played a significant role in its completion, surpassing even her father's contributions. The Tohsaka's duty in this ritual is to provide their Spiritual Land for its execution. The Tohsaka family's rich history and diverse pursuits make them an intriguing and influential force within the world of Magecraft."

Originally from Russia, they sought refuge in Japan and changed their name to Matou. However, over the past 200 years, they have experienced a decline in their magical abilities, with many of their descendants losing their capacity to manifest Magic Circuits. The true reason behind this decline remains unclear. Their last remaining heir, Shinji Matou, has no Magic Circuits at all. The practice of passing down their Magic Crest among family members ceased generations ago. With no other options to continue their bloodline, the Matou family began taking in pupils from other families. However, due to their prideful nature and questionable practices, no one willingly seeks out their mentorship. In a bid to secure an heir, Zouken Matou approached the Tohsaka family and adopted Sakura Tohsaka into the Matou lineage. The Magecraft of the Matou family revolves around the concept of \"absorbing\" or binding something to oneself. Their teaching method involves physically carving magecraft knowledge into the body using Crest Worms. This torturous process allows the body itself to learn magecraft rather than relying on intellectual understanding. While efficient, it is a horrifying practice that Rin Tohsaka states could yield even greater power than her own magecraft abilities within a few months. The Matou family has made significant contributions to Thaumaturgy research and played a role in establishing the Servant system and creating Command Spells for Masters."
