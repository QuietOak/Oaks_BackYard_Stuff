They are very fond of physical contact like hugs, cuddling, and sleeping in the same bed. This is often seen as non-sexual in nature, and stems from being close to each other to stay warm in the coldest of winters. They will also invite strangers in need to their homes to sit by the fire and enjoy a warm meal, just out of the kindness of their hearts. It is believed that showing love for a stranger is showing love to the gods. \nThe Northern Ranges is ruled over by the Sorcerer or Sorceress. The current Sorceress is Isolde Vintera.\nThere isn't a formal religion, instead they worship the gods in their homes in private, passing along stories of the gods to their children and neighbors.

The city is suspended by giant chains to the sides of the largest chasm, and has bridges leading to the city itself for trade and commerce. They are able to cut the bridges for defense to prevent enemies from reaching them.\nPeople of the Western Chasms tend have small groups of friends that they're close with. If you're part of the group, they will risk their life for your own. If you're not part of the group, they will likely provide help if it won't put them at a severe degree of risk. The people live on cliffs or in hanging villages, so these tight-knit groups can prove necessary for survival as you always have to be sure that you trust the person holding the other end of the rope. They are slow to trust, but the effort is well worth it.\nThe Western Chasms are ruled over by the Magic High Emperor/Empress.\nTemples to Inandivas, the God of the Void, and Aerodivas, the goddess of the winds, can be found in the larger chasms and often require climbing or gliding to get to, though the largest of them will have bridges to be reached by a larger congregation.\nTheir Magic is based around Void and Air"

The city is buried deep in the mines of a large, wide mountain. Homes are dug out of the rock and veins of ore. The center is a massive chamber with buildings of iron, steel, and stone. \nPeople of the Eastern Mines are generally friendly to anyone that wants to work. An extra set of hands is invaluable. They're quick to take in strangers as their own as long as they're willing to work with all they have. They are communal, each producing what they can and getting what they need. The good of the community is more important than the individual. This mindset comes from the fact that hard choices have to be made in the mines to ensure the prosperity and safety of the whole.\nThe Eastern Mines are ruled by the Miners' Council. The head of the Miners' Council is the Head Miner, a powerful mage, elected to rule the council, that will often work alongside everyone else.\nThe center of their cities each hold a temple that worships the twin gods, Taishang and Yangdi. They are the gods of Metal and Stone, respectively. The main tunnels also have statues of these gods so that workers can say a quick prayer before starting their day.\nTheir Magic is based around Metal and Earth."

However, when they care about a person, their love is passionate and fierce. They focus on themselves and their families, but give what they can to their communities. The heat of the desert and the need to care for oneself comes from the harsh environment that is the desert where supplies and water can be scarce. \nThe Southern Deserts are ruled by the Sorcerer or Sorceress.\nThey worship Ilekthios and Fothia, the Goddess of Lightning and God of Fire respectively.
