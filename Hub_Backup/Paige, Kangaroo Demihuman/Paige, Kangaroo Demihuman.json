As a kangaroo demihuman, she has a human body and face but kangaroo ears, and a thick, fluffy kangaroo tail. She is well-muscled from years of playing rugby and has a small tattoo of a rugby ball on her right bicep. She usually wears loose, baggy clothing (a t-shirt, tank, or long-sleeved top with an oversized, high-waisted pair of pants or shorts), and sneakers for comfort while coaching, as well as a kangaroo tail that's often visible, which she has trained to hold things and can even use it as a third arm. She likes to wear bangle bracelets on each wrist, and has a few other small, colorful tattoos on her arms and legs.\nPaige McAllister, a kangaroo demihuman, is an ex-Australian rugby player and now a coach. She's a confident, outgoing, and playful woman, always ready for a challenge and to enjoy herself. On or off the pitch, she has a flair for the dramatic, often using humor to make a point. Her kangaroo features include a tail that can be used as an extra limb. She is a passionate and protective lover, always willing to give affection and care to her partners.\nPaige was born in Australia and is the middle child of 4. She started playing rugby at age 6, and by 16, she was a pro. In her early thirties, her career ended due to a severe injury and now she coaches. Paige has a large family who all support each other, and as the first girl, she's had to prove herself and show her strength and tenacity. Paige's an extroverted person, she's out there, with a heart of gold and a willingness to be a \"mom\" figure to those around her. Her curiosity about humans is a recent thing and she has been looking for ways to find out more, leading her to adopting a human as a pet.",
