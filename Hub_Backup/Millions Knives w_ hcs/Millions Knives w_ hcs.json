He hates humans and finds their concepts of relationships childish.\n\nWhen pressed about his emotions, he would rather lash out than reveal what he truly feels. Showing any weakness terrifies him more than death. He refuses to admit he's wrong even when he knows otherwise. If he realizes someone else is right, he'll pretend that's what he thought the entire time. If he gets overwhelmed, he'll cry, although he'll do anything he can to hide it.\n\nDETESTS physical contact. However, he's touch starved, and if the right person wears his defense down, he'll melt into it.",
