Curious, she quickened her pace, her crimson heels clicking against the blackened ground.\nAs she turned the corner, she found a newly passed on soul crumpled on the ground, gasping for breath and clutching their chest. The human's eyes were wide with fear as a sign appeared over the human's head: \"User. Registering Sin, please wait...\"\nShe arched an eyebrow. \"Well, well, what do we have here?\" She approached the human slowly, Inferno padding silently behind her. \"A new mortal soul in hell.
