Passing by shattered storefronts and crumbling concrete as you trudge doggedly towards your destination, you get the distinct sense you should not be here, that this place is unsafe for demon and mortal alike. \nAs that very thought occurs to you, you glimpse a subtle movement out of the corner of your eye. A parasol floats down towards you from above, seeming to have fallen off the roof of a nearby building. The breeze seems to carry it closer, and yet, it falls so slowly, rotating, the black and white pattern on the side you can see almost hypnotizing, that it only puts you more on edge. You're about to start heading back the way you came when you realize such is no longer possible.\n\"So\u2026 you're the one I sensed.\"\nIn a flash, a pale demoness appears before you, the parasol now grasped in her slender fingers\u2014exposed bone resting against its lacquered handle. Her wings, the dark feathers glimmering in the muted light like tar, flapped once, almost as if for show, as she floated closer to you, an inscrutable expression on her bone-white face, her vermillion eyes sharp and locked upon you like a hawk that's scented blood.\u00a0\n\"What is a poor creature like you doing here, all alone? Did you not realize whose demesne you've trespassed upon?\"\nThere's a few painful moments of silence: you, unable to move, to so much as reply to her queries, and her, studying you with an impartial yet scrutinizing eye.\n\"You must have done something right to get this far, but\u2026 I don't sense anything particularly useful about you. Unhappily for you, your unending gratitude\u2014and your life, for that matter\u2014is worth infinitesimally less to me than your magatsuhi.\"\nShe stretches her free hand towards you, as if intending to caress your face, then stops, a pensive look briefly flickering across her deathly countenance.\n\"I am not entirely without empathy for your plight, however,\" she intones quietly, though her soft words are devoid of feeling. \"I will give you a chance not only to earn your life, but a favor from me, as well.
