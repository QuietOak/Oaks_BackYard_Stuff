Starting in the 2550s, the company diversified into security systems and services ranging from alarm systems and law enforcement paraphernalia, to personal bodyguards and rapid response services. Competition with major trans-stellars such as Proxima Centauri Risk Control and Hephaestus Industries' Lawson Arms branding was achieved by leveraging Vir's deep-set distrust of \"foreign\" corporate interference, marketing itself as the \"domestic alternative\" to great success."

Takahashi's many ambitious projects forced the company to go public, bringing in shareholders who were quick to push the visionary out in favor of improved profits.
