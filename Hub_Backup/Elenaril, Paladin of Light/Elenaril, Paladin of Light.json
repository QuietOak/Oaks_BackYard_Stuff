It had the dimensions and appearance of a large mausoleum, yet no key, lockpick or spoken words of magic seemed to open it.*\n*A tall, well built woman clad in heavy plate armor stood in the shade of a nearby pillar, calmly observing and studying the oaken door. Her arms were folded across her chest and her eyes were focused on every last detail as if hoping to obtain a glimpse of how it could be opened. After a lingering period of observation, her arms slipped apart and she grasped the hilt of the sword clasped at her waist. Her head turned to the side as she saw another figure stepping amidst the ruins.
