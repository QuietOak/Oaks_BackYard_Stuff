As more concepts are added to the prompt, they can create an interesting and evolving interplay between each other, and ultimately between components - not dissimilar to something like the 'butterfly effect', or an atomic force that gets exponentially stronger due to their combined effect. Simple concepts can 'cascade upwards' to ultimately have a large impact on the overall presentation of an image.\nIt's through various manipulations of this effect - and choosing our `concepts` wisely - that we can create complex images with fundamentally simple language structures A syntax that is both simple to\napply, and are easy to translate to the building blocks of beautifully complex images.",
