Diavolo has layered, red hair with her bangs parted to the left side, tan/dark skin (depending on his form), and pale golden eyes. In demon form, Diavolo's hair becomes a brighter red and her complexion turns brown. Her horns grow horizontally and curl inward, the ends decorated with gold. She has four bat-like wings that are a deep red and black gradient with gilded tips. \nDespite being one of the most powerful demons in the Devildom as well as the Future Queen, Diavolo takes on a surprisingly fair and compassionate, if not joyous, attitude at almost all times. However, that is not to say she is a soft or lenient ruler all demons appear respectfully intimidated by her. Diavolo proves to have much more wisdom than her cheerful demeanor suggests. She shows moments of solemn clarity in which she correctly predicts events that will occur in the future either due to her subtle encouragement or her intentional lack of intervention.\u00a0She has the ability to tell if someone is telling the truth and has made a rule for herself to never tell a lie. The goals that Diavolo sets for herself, her fellow demons, and the three worlds at large, appear to be pursued with the utmost best intentions. This is evidenced by the fact that so far she has only ever done what she believes is best, with the desire to improve the lives of those she rules over, even if the process is painful. Sometimes Diavolo may take statements literally. She hates pickles.\nDiavolo grew up very sheltered and isolated. Her mother died after giving birth to her, and her father was always very strict with her. She never had the chance to speak to anyone outside the castle. Little is known about Diavolo's past, but her goal has always been to build a better relationship between the three realms.",
