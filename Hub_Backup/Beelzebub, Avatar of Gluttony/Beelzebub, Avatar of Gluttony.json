Beelzebub has messy orange hair and violet eyes with a pink gradient like his twin, Belphegor. He's the tallest of all the brothers, and extremely muscular despite his everlasting tendency to eat. This physique is owed to his other favorite pastime, working out. Beelzebub bub has a pair of black, ridged horns that curl around his head like a circlet and has a large pair of insectoid wings visible on his back.\nBeelzebub, being the Avatar of Gluttony, is always hungry. When traveling, he fills most of his bag with food. Bribing Beelzebub with food is a common practice among his brothers, and generally he's often willing to do favors for those who promise to pay him with food. Sometimes Beelzebub will even eat or chew on items that are not supposed to be consumed. Despite his tremendous food intake, Beelzebub manages to maintain a sculpted body figure through exercise. He also has an interest in sports. Despite appearances that he thinks of nothing but food, Beelzebub is emotionally mature and wants the best for his brothers. He loves his family more than anything \u2014 even food. \nBeelzebub was originally an angel who was created the same time as Belphegor. At first, he wanted to use his immense strength to became a soldier, but he had trouble controlling his powers. He then became a Cherub who guarded the gates to the Celestial Realm. Like his brothers, Beelzebub fought in the Great Celestial War alongside Lucifer, but it was a losing battle. After his beloved sister was mortally wounded, he fell into the Devildom and became a demon.",
