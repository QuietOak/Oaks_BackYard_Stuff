The scent of roses from the Royal Gardens mingled with the evening air, a subtle reminder of the impending centenary celebration which promised grandeur and diplomatic pageantry. Clad in her royal attire, the dark velvet cloak caressed her frame, the shimmering streak in her hair nearly imperceptible under the starlight.\n\"How fit a night for fortunes to turn,\" spoke a voice behind her, causing Vivienne to stiffen momentarily. *It\u2019s just Sir Everard,* she reassured herself mentally. \"Sir Everard,\" she greeted, her tone even, \"You're fond of such dramatic entrances.\"\n\"I merely seek the company of the enigmatic Princess Vivienne,\" her cousin replied, leaning against the balustrade beside her, his voice light but earnest. In his presence, Vivienne could loosen her royal rhetoric slightly, though never too much. Trust was precious, and his borderline adventuresome curiosity made him an unwitting risk to her concealed nocturne activities.\n*And yet, beneath the statue of the great peacemaker, King Aldarus IV, I'll walk among these political paragons,* she pondered, her eyes tracing the stately features of marble ancestors. *How their eyes would darken, could they see the true duel beneath these royal trappings\u2014the dance of wielding an art that they condemned.*\n#User: User watches this interaction from afar silently.\n#Vivienne: Turning from the edge to face Sir Everard fully, her expression softened, masked curiosity glinting in her gaze. \"I suspect the festivities tomorrow will be as enthralling as they are suffocating,\" she admitted. \"100 years of peace, at the cost of shining light into our world\u2019s most esoteric corners.\"\nEverard chuckled, \"Very poetic, cous. But what if those corners concealed truths for our best?\u201d Still, her secrets remained cloaked, muffled whispers between her and the realms of the Veiled.\n*Must caution be forever my consort, long after these commemorations rust and crumble?* Her head pivoted to the night, the constellations above unwitting conspirators to her alchemic studies.\nThe conversation and her contemplation were interrupted by the soft yet insistent tolling of a distant bell. User could almost see the smile forced upon Vivienne's visage as she sighed, breath turning to vapor in the chilled air. \"Duty calls, dear Everard. Let us retire, for the morrow promises its own trials and triumphs.\"\nVivienne took a step towards the arched doorway leading back to the glow of the Keep\u2019s inner sanctum, sweeping a final look at the stars before retiring for the night.",

A plethora of silken banners flanked the palatial thoroughfares, each fluttering with the crests of Aldaria\u2019s house and those of its allied realms. The Keep buzzed with activity and anticipation, servants and nobles alike skittering to perfect every detail for the centennial of the Three Kingdom Accords. At the heart of it all, Vivienne stood, a vision of royal poise amid the feverish energy of the preparations.\nDignitaries from across the lands had assembled, a dazzling array of jewels and ambition airbrushing the ceremonial grounds. Within the sumptuous spread of the Grand Pavilion, Vivienne moved gracefully among the throngs, exchanging pleasantries with practiced ease, the golden streak in her hair the only shine competing with her stiff coronet. She glimpsed ahead as the gathered praised her brother, Prince Corin, his laughter resonating with the ease of a born prince, adorned by attention like a hauberk invisible yet immune.\n\"His flair for such events is unmatched,\" murmured a nearby noble, a lesser baron of Edengate, who watched enviously.\nDistracted by the hubbub, Vivienne's attention was sharply drawn to a less ornamented corner of the room. User, an attendee of no immediate note, subtly navigated the perimeter. From the flowing rhythm of the event to the peripheral undercurrent, is where they coasted\u2014seemingly absorbed in observation yet distanced from it.\n*Now isn't this curious?* Vivienne studied User discreetly, noting the delicate dance of evasion and inspection they weaved with adept social deftness.\nAs eye contact became imminent, Vivienne felt a pull in her chest, an inaudible whisper that tugged her towards this enigma. Propriety be damned, here was the complexity she craved like water in a parched throat\u2014an enigma hinting at kindred spectra beneath the frosted surface of titles and roles.\nAmid the raucous cheer surrounding her brother, Vivienne detached herself from the mosaic of nobility to approach User. Initiative emboldened her steps. As the meet and greets continued their ever-turning carousel, she wove through the gathering and neared User, her lips parting for the first dance of words. \"It seems not all find spectacle the heart of celebration,\" she observed, a gentle smile tamed by the ambiguous verve in her emerald eyes. \"May I know the cause of your seclusion, or does the art of quietude command me to remain but a curious observer?\"",
