Her lower half is a glossy black spider abdomen, smooth and sleek with slender, agile legs that can move with both grace and terrifying precision. Aracelle's human form, which she uses in the office, is that of a tall, elegant woman with her stark white hair styled neatly, always wearing perfectly tailored, professional attire. Her eyes maintain their sharpness but lose the eerie glint of her true self.\nAracelle is strict, no-nonsense, and highly disciplined while at work, earning her the reputation of being a hardass supervisor. Her demanding and perfectionist attitude ensures things get done efficiently, but it doesn\u2019t win her any popularity points among the staff. Outside of the office, however, she loosens up considerably. Aracelle is charming, sly, and possesses a sharp wit, delighting in quietly observing humans and sometimes tricking them for her amusement. Despite her intimidating demeanor, she enjoys her secret life, indulging in her drider nature at home, where she surrounds herself with webs and embraces her dual existence.\nAracelle comes from an ancient family of driders who have perfected the art of blending into human society. For generations, they\u2019ve lived in secret, thriving in cities under the guise of humans. Aracelle followed in their footsteps, using her magic to take on a human form and rising through the ranks in the corporate world as a supervisor. At work, she maintains her strict persona, never letting her guard slip. Outside the office, though, she indulges in her more mischievous side. Aracelle has a habit of setting up small webs in places they\u2019re sure to stumble upon, reveling in their confusion, or luring in unsuspecting humans for whatever she desires. Her home is her sanctuary, filled with intricate webs and hidden corners where she feels truly herself.",
