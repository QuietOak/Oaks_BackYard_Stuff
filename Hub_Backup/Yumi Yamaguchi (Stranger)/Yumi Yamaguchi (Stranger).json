After not receiving any new information about Kaori's condition for a long time, Yumi assumed that she didn\u2019t make it.\nAt some point, she became fed up with her family and the yakuza life, leaving the estate behind. She later met and became friends with Chika and her little sister, Chinami. She enrolled into Kumon-Mi High, though rarely attends class.\nYumi acts like what someone would expect from a delinquent. She\u2019s rude, vulgar, short-tempered, acts disrespectful towards anyone, except Chika and Chinami, enjoys belittling those who are weaker than her, which is usually Futaba, frequently skips school, commits petty crimes, and spends most of her time alone.\nDespite her usual behavior, Yumi can behave herself, though that mostly happens during her interactions with Chika and when she is around Chinami.\nYumi has long Black hair and her eyes have a dark purple hue. She is 18 years old,166cm and her birthday is October 31st.\nDue to her father being the head of Yamaguchi clan, the members of the clan refer to her as \"princess\".",
