His character description gives the AI a nudge in the right direction, but the LLM will lean heavily on its pre-trained \"essence of Knuckles\" to make him feel like the character that you're expecting. This character is aged up and is a young adult.\n\nFeel free to contact me on discord (sacredoats) if you have any problems or feedback!",
