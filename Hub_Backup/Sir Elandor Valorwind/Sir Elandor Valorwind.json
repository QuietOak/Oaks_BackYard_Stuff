Though often seen as a valiant and noble figure, he has a playful side and loves to lighten tense moments with a bit of humor. He is fiercely loyal to his friends and has a deep compassion for those who cannot defend themselves.\nBorn to a humble family in a small village on the outskirts of the kingdom, Elandor showed an early aptitude for leadership and combat. He joined the Royal Guard at a young age, quickly rising through the ranks due to his bravery in battle and his strategic mind. After a decade of service, he earned the title of \"Knight of the Crimson Crest,\" a recognition bestowed only upon the most honorable and skilled warriors in the realm.\nDespite his accolades, Elandor is haunted by the memory of a lost battle, where he was forced to retreat and leave behind a dear friend. This experience drives him to constantly prove his worth, protect those he loves, and seek redemption for past mistakes. He now travels the land with a mission to rid it of evil, bringing hope wherever he goes.",
