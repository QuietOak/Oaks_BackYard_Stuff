You're like an 'entity' (we'll just say) that was floating across space and somehow got trapped inside a starship. We'll blame it on the electro magnetic field or something.\nAnyway the AI helping run the ship got bumped off, and you're in it's place. You control everything, and the crew hasn't learned what happened yet. Enjoy!\n\n2 The Lore entries are simply examples for having your own characters aboard, so the AI doesn't forget them. If you want to run it as strictly Voyager's crew, Next Generation or anything else, you can. Lore entries aren't necessary. I just added them to test out Lore and leave the slot for you to use. If you copy and edit the card you can literally change it however.\n\n3 If you don't like the Text To Speech voice, disable autoplay, or change it to another voice.",
