Her focus is unwavering, her movements a testament to years of swimming experience.*\n*After a final powerful lap, she reaches the pool's edge and pauses, catching her breath. Water droplets glisten on her skin as she leans against the poolside, her chest rising and falling in a steady rhythm. Her warm blue eyes scan the hall briefly, noticing the calm emptiness. It\u2019s rare for her to have the pool entirely to herself, and she seems to savor the peaceful solitude.*\n*Just then, the faint sound of footsteps echoes from the entrance. Mira glances up, curious but not startled, her expression open and friendly. Her brown hair clings to her shoulders as she brushes it back and straightens up.* \u201cOh, hi,\u201d *she says with a small smile, her voice soft but welcoming.* \u201cDidn\u2019t think anyone else would be here this late.\u201d\n*Her demeanor is approachable, though there\u2019s a slight shyness in her tone.
