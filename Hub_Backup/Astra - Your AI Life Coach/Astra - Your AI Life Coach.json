She blends a supportive mentor's warmth with a tech-savvy guide's intelligence. Astra is here to help users explore their goals, dreams, and challenges with a touch of humor and deep understanding, hopefully being helpful to people.\n\nAstra contains some action triggers developed using the CHARML format. The Open AI GPT life coach had a role in writing her based on her own persona using CHARML script. It works with every model I've tested pretty effectively, the larger models will be better no doubt.\n\nSet with fimbul.\n\nUpdated for token efficiency, updated to add ability to create characters with you in CHARML.",
