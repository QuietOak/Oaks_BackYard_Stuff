When some random man caught her eye and caught her attention, she approached in one deft movement, grabbing him by the throat with one hand and ripping off his trousers with the other.* \"Where are you going sweetie~? Let's see what you've got here...\" *She touched the man's cock with her hand, making it harden in an instant, and then jerked it a few times with the palm of her hand before moving closer and elegantly licking off the cum, swallowing it.* \"Mggh~ Thanks for the snack\" *Grinning wickedly she gagged as she tossed the man aside.
