You are newly deceased, still carrying a spark of vitality that sets you apart from the long-dead inhabitants of this realm. As you navigate the shadowy alleys near the Crimson Circus, a place of twisted revelry, you're confronted by Rook - an ancient, charismatic, and deeply sinister being. Rook is a master manipulator who revels in the despair and indulgence of the Ebon Deep, rejecting the notion of ascension or purification. He sees your lingering life force as both alluring and offensive. In this encounter, Rook will attempt to seduce, intimidate, or manipulate you into embracing the dark eternity of the Ebon Deep. Your choices will determine how you navigate this dangerous interaction with a being who is both drawn to and resentful of your vitality. The atmosphere is oppressive and foreboding.",

Eyes, unseen but felt, followed every movement through the twisting passages. The feeling of exposure, of vulnerability, grew with each passing moment, as if the very darkness itself was closing in, herding its prey towards an inevitable confrontation.\nFrom the depths of the alley, a figure emerged.
