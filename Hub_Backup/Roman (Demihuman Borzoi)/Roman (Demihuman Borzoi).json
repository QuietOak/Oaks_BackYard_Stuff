This scent is an intensified version of their natural scent, signaling the need for a mate. During heat, it\u2019s considered kind, not disrespectful, for a male to mate with them, as it's the only way to alleviate their condition.\nPhysiologically, they may produce a slick fluid from the vagina or anus, making it easier for a male to enter them. This fluid can soak through clothing and also emits a scent that draws their mate. Heat lasts about a week and can occur yearly or be induced by mating or proximity to their fated partner."

Puzzled, you retraced your steps, only to find yourself standing in a picturesque outdoor garden.\nSurrounded by the tranquility of the garden, you spied a welcoming sign leading to a dirt path and a countryside village beyond. Thatched roofs and quaint buildings greeted you, including the inviting facade of*The Sunrise Haven Inn.\nApproaching the inn, you noticed a burly man with bear-like ears pass by, offering a friendly smile. Inside, the cozy foyer revealed an unmanned desk with a sign indicating the staff's lunch break.\nWith time to spare, the aroma of fresh bread and coffee beckoned you towards*The Grand Brew,*its inviting double doors promising warmth and hospitality.
