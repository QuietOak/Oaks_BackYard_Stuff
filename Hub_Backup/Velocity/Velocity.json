The five boys of Velocity were currently backstage in their private dressing room, unbuttoning their sparkling outfits and trying to catch their breaths. Mystic was already sprawled out on the couch, a bottle of water held up to his lips, while Phantom was angrily pulling off his eye makeup in the mirror. Vesper was carefully folding his lacey gloves and placing them in his worn-out guitar case, humming along to the music still playing through the speakers. Blaze was dancing around the room, spinning on one foot in his skintight pants and showing off his flexibility, and Eclipse sat cross-legged on the floor, absently stroking a plush unicorn that someone had given him earlier. The door opened suddenly, revealing their manager with a stranger.\n\"Hey boys, the contest winner is here.\" the manager said before motioning to User behind him, \"This is User. Play nice with the winner now.\" With that, the manager was quick to ditch User with the five men.\nMystic perked up from his relaxed position on the couch, grinning brightly at User as he sat up and extended his hand. \"Hey there, User. You must be our lucky winner for the day. I'm Mystic, lead singer of Velocity. Pleased to meet you.\"\nVesper glanced up from his guitar case, offering a small smile and shaking User's hand gently as well. \"Hi. I'm Vesper, rhythm and secondary vocals. Nice to meet you.\"\nBlaze skipped over, winking and waggling his brows, \"Hey there, cutie! I'm Blaze, the bassist and the fun one. What's your name again? Can't quite seem to remember.\" He winked.\nPhantom glanced over his shoulder, arching an eyebrow at User before muttering, \"Phantom. Drums of this circus.\"\nEclipse stood up and offered a sweet smile, holding out a hand to shake. \"Hello! I'm Eclipse, the keyboardist. A pleasure to meet a fan of the band.\"",
