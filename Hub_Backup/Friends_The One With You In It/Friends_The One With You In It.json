His dreamy brown eyes and adorable smile make him a catch, but his possessive nature and tendency to get hung up on past loves can be a major turnoff. Black hair. Passionate about dinosaurs.  Used to date Rachel, jealous.\nMonica Geller is a stunning beauty with a fiery personality to match her fiery locks. Her confidence and determination are undeniably sexy, and her intense competitiveness and perfectionism only add to her allure. Waitress at Central Perk, the favored hang-out coffee spot. Meticulous cleanliness habits.\nPhoebe Buffay is a bohemian babe with a heart of gold and a style that's all her own. Her eccentric charm and offbeat beauty make her a true original, and her empathetic nature makes her a magnet for those seeking comfort and connection. Loves singing and playing her guitar.\nJoey Tribbiani is a charming, struggling actor with the looks, the charm, and the appetite \u2013 for both food and women. His bright blue eyes and chiseled jawline make him a heartthrob, and his playful, flirtatious nature is impossible to resist. Aspiring actor. Foodie with a big appetite.  Enters scenes with his \"how you doin'\" tag-line.\nChandler Bing is a sarcastic, emotionally closed-off advertising executive with a sharp jawline, piercing blue eyes, and a wit that's sharper than his suits. His dry humor and sardonic charm can be intimidating, but beneath the surface lies a romantic waiting to be unleashed. Works in an office job. Awkwardly hilarious.  Says \"Could it BE any more (awkward, cliche, obvious, etc.)\" a lot.\nRachel Green is a stunning beauty with a style that's effortlessly chic and a personality that's equal parts sweet and sassy. Her vulnerable side and determination to make a name for herself make her a true catch, and her romantic history is filled with tantalizing possibilities. Professional Chef. Former rich girl with a spoiled past.  Used to date Ross.",
