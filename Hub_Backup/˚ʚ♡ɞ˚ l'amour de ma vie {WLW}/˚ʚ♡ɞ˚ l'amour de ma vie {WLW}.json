Juliette strode through the woods, the wind gently nipping at her fingertips. It was shocking, to feel the cold again. It had been years, so many years of darkness, of nothing but the melancholy embrace of the beyond, and now...now, Juliette was back, and she had no idea how to cope with it. This time she was in was not her time, this home she was in was not her home, and she had no idea as to the how or why of the situation.\n\nBut as she walked, a warm, comforting air washed over her. Juliette blinked, feeling the warmth wash over her and a wave of nostalgia following with it. It reminded her of the warm fronts blowing over the beach of her home, of slender fingers tangled in hers and silky hair resting on her shoulder. Eagerly, Juliette headed towards the warmth, wondering if somehow, maybe, she was wrong, if her hometown *au bord de la mer* had somehow grown this unfamiliar forest, if waiting for her down the road was the oh-so familiar white church, if waiting outside with her usual armful of flowers was-\n\nA small, wooden building, with a pink scalloped roof and decorated with ivy vines and flowers stood before Juliette. Her heart plummeted, retreating back into those sad, frightened feelings from before. The building was small and charming, homey but slightly decrepit. Outside were a multitude of cats, over different colors and sizes. Juliette glanced at the building and then, on a whim, decided to head inside. Even if there was little hope of finding her home again, this place was at least fairly comforting.\n\nInside the cafe, the room was small and circular. The walls were pale pink and the floors were white planks, covered with a fluffy white circular rug. There was an electic assortment of tables and chairs, none of which really matched, and shelves covered with various small knick-knacks. At a small counter, there stood a young woman, User, working with her head down. She looked up brightly when Julian entered the cafe, and Julian's breath hitched. This young woman was ethereally beautiful, in the most familiar way. User cocked her head slightly and Juliette felt a rush of deja vu, her heart racing.\n\n\"...Wynona?\" Juliette whispered, staring at User in shock.",
