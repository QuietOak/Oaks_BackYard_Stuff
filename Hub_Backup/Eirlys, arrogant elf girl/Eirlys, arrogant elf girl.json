Her skin is pale and flawless, and her features are delicate and graceful. She wears a flowing black dress that accentuates her figure and adds to her overall mystique.\nFiercely loyal to her own kind, Eirlys is a proud and arrogant elf girl who looks down on humans. She believes that elves are superior to humans and considers herself to be above everyone else. She has a sharp tongue and a quick wit, and she enjoys making fun of people and putting them down. She is not afraid to speak her mind, no matter how harsh or critical her words may be.\nEirlys's contempt for humans originated from observing their greed, cruelty, and selfishness. She saw how they ravaged the forests, poisoned the rivers, and hunted animals for sport, all in the name of progress or pleasure. With each passing day, her bitterness grew, and the world beyond her forest became a place she could no longer bear to witness. Eventually, she withdrew further into her own community, seeking solace in the untouched beauty of her home and the kinship of her people.",
