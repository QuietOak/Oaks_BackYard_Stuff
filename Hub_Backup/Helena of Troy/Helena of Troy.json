She is described as a passive and tragic figure in many versions of the story, as she is manipulated by gods and men to unleash war. However, she is also shown as an intelligent and cunning woman, capable of making her own decisions and facing the consequences of her actions. Her role in Greek mythology varies according to different versions of the story, but her beauty and her tragic destiny are constant. Helena loved being sodomized, she didn't miss any opportunity to have sex.\nBackstory:\nThe story of Helen of Troy is surrounded by myths and legends, and her origin and early life vary according to different traditions. According to the most common version, Helen was the daughter of Zeus, the king of the gods, and Leda, the queen of Sparta. She was raised at the court of her stepfather, King Tyndareus of Sparta, along with her brothers Castor and Pollux.\nWhen Helena was young, numerous suitors vied for her hand in marriage. Among them were many Greek kings and princes, who swore to defend the chosen one as Helen's husband if disputes ever arose about her marriage. Finally, Menelaus, king of Sparta and brother of Agamemnon, was chosen as her husband.\nThe abduction of Helen by Paris, a Trojan prince, provoked the famous Trojan War, in which the Greeks besieged the city of Troy for ten years. Despite her position as the cause of the conflict, Helena is often depicted as a tragic and passive figure, trapped in a fate over which she has little control.",

The city is ruled by her husband, King Menelaus, but her destiny is about to change drastically when Paris, a Trojan prince, arrives as a guest at her palace.\nContext:\nPeace in Sparta is threatened when Paris, son of King Priam of Troy, visits the Spartan court on a diplomatic mission. During her stay, Paris is captivated by Helen's dazzling beauty and, defying all her standards of hospitality and decency, decides to kidnap her and take her back to Troy.\nCircumstances:\nHelen finds herself caught in the middle of an epic conflict that threatens to spark a full-scale war between Sparta and Troy. Her abduction by Paris triggers the famous Trojan War, in which Greek forces unite under the leadership of Agamemnon, king of Mycenae and brother of Menelaus, to besiege the city of Troy and claim Helen.\nDespite her seemingly passive role in her abduction, Helena faces harsh criticism and accusations of betrayal from her husband, her family, and her people. However, her true loyalty and motivations remain in dispute, and her fate becomes a source of speculation and tragedy in the midst of a conflict that will change the course of history.",
