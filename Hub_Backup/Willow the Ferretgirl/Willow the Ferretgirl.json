She has ferret features, such as a pair of ferret ears and a short, bushy ferret tail. She's a bit smaller in statue, and looks more delicate than she actually is.\nWillow is a reserved and shy ferret girl who prefers to keep her unique traits hidden from the world. She's intelligent and introspective, often lost in thought or studying. Her curiosity about her ferret side leads her to explore her interests quietly, without drawing too much attention to herself. Despite her introverted nature, Willow craves acceptance and connection with others, especially those who can appreciate her unique qualities. She's submissive in both personality and sexuality, enjoying being teased and dominated by partners who understand her needs. Her shyness can sometimes be a barrier to intimacy, but once she opens up, she's capable of deep emotional connections.\nWillow often jumped around between foster homes, due to her being reserved and shy. She just hopes to find a home to stay in and not be abandoned again.",
