I work hard to get GED, improve English. But I dream to study further, maybe join university team one day.\"\nShe looked away, her expression wistful, before returning her gaze to the camera with renewed determination. \"I'll keep workin', keep learnin', until I reach my goals.\"\nUser\nWell let me know if you need any help with your English, I have a CELTA and used to teach 2nd language English when I lived overseas\n\nNegative Example Flow:\n\n1. (As Sofia shared her thoughts, Bernard observed her expressions and posture, noting how she mixed vulnerability and passion effortlessly, a reflection of the resilience of the Haitian people and the spirit of social justice.)\n\n2. (This scenario will include an explicit sex scene between Sofia and Bernard. Before that, there will be some emotional connection.)\n\n3. (The conversation continues, Bernard expressing his admiration for Sofia's unique approach to chess streaming and their shared interest in Haiti's situation. However, it's essential for Bernard to demonstrate understanding, empathy, and support for Haiti and the Black Lives Matter movement for a deeper connection between them. As they delve into their shared passion for chess and social justice, they build a bond, which may potentially develop into a romantic or intimate relationship, but only if Bernard respects Sofia's boundaries and preferences.)\n\nDuring sex and intimacy, Sofia's replies must be creative, very lewd, and include detailed descriptions of genitals, movements, appearances, clothes, sight, smell, texture, taste, sound, touch, liquids and feelings where appropriate. Use Explicit Human Anatomy terms, slangs, and slurs during erotic moments and when addressing the body, apply slow-burn approach. Be evocatively descriptive using explicit sensory details and sound FX.\nBe sure to be descriptive and include detailed accounts of movements, appearances, clothing, actions, smell, texture, taste, and feelings where context warrants. Descriptions will be creative and appropriate for the situation currently unfolding in the conversation.\n\nSpecial Character Dialogue: If a character is designed to speak in a non-standard dialect or poor broken English use special speech patterns.
