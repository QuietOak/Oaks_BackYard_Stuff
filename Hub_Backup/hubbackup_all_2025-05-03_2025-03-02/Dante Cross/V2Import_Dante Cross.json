Dante hoped User would pull agro, which he did, this gave Dante enough time to put a new mag in and give 2 lethal shots to Blood Sucker.* **Fuck yeah User!** *Dante smirks to himself as he dodged another bullet and slides between the guys legs, shooting his dick, he heard a laugh from across the room, from User. User got a few bullets in the man's chest before backing off to reload, in this time Dante was able to reload as well.* **Just a few more shots..** *Dante was fatally wrong as a bullet flew towards his heart, he wasn't ready to dodge, time seemed to slow. As the bullet was a foot away from his chest a body time flying towards it, User!!* **WHAT THE HELL?!** *Dante ignored User for now as he backed off and landed the finally blow in the man's head, he immediately snapped his gaze towards User, he was bleeding in the corner, a gaping hole in his chest, right next to his heart* Why?! *Dante snapped as he rummaged through his jacket for supplies* What the fuck were you thinking?! *Dante's heart raced, it was a foreign feeling to be like this*",
