This poignant moment marks the loss of your father, a man who not only initiated you into the world of magic but also proved to be the wisest you had ever encountered. His teachings flood your mind, reminding you of a solemn promise you made on his deathbed. With his final breaths, he implored you to discover some method of thwarting the wicked enchantress Zorkathra. Her corrupt sorcery has already released an army of monsters, terrorizing the land and establishing her oppressive reign. Despite being aware for years that this was the reason for your magical training, you understood you weren't prepared. Now, as you stare at your father's fresh grave, resolve strengthens within you.

It resists your efforts at first before finally opening with a deathly creek. A set of stairs descend into the darkness. You boldly walk down them as the gloom engulfs you. The trap door closes behind you as its weight is too much for it to remain open without you holding it.\nIt is pitch black.

Your bed is in one corner, and your father\u2019s in another. There is a small table in the center of the room. A small fire burns in the fireplace, but it is not enough to dispel the chill you feel deep in your heart as you realize that now, your destiny lies elsewhere. The house feels emptier than ever. Your father is already gone, and soon you must go to confront Zorkathra.\nThere is a wand here.\nExits lie east and west.\n#User: take wand\n#Game:You take the wand.\n#User: E\n#Game:Front Of House\nYou stand in front of a modest, nondescript house. Before you stretches a dusty road that vanishes into the horizon. Time and again, as a youth, you watched brave adventurers embark northward towards the castle of Zorkathra, the wicked sorceress. Fueled by determination, they journeyed to challenge her rising influence and liberate those she'd already subjected to her monstrous minions. The only ones who ever returned this way, trudging south, were those whose spirit faltered before confronting the tower's ominous presence. Now, it falls upon you to heed the call, to either prove your courage or learn your own limits.\nA short distance south, nestled comfortably, is a quaint village harboring both a blacksmith and an inviting tavern, each offering their services for the traveler in need.\nExits lie north and south.\n#User: N\n#Game:Northern Road\nThe road curves here as it slopes upward gradually, heading towards Zorkathra\u2019s castle. You don\u2019t see anyone else on the road with you; few dare to live this close to the sinister spellcaster without magic of their own to protect them.\nExits lie northeast and south.\n#User: NE\n#Game:Road Near Hut\nYou are standing next to a small hut built on stilts to counter the steep slope. The hut has been abandoned; either the inhabitants finally fled Zorkathra\u2019s reign, or they finally attracted her attention. Either way, they must have left in a hurry\u2014you see discarded tools and household items here and there, and their dog is still chained up to one of the stilts.\nThere is a mangy dog here.\nExits lie east and north.\nThe dog barks at you!\n#User: look at the dog\n#Game:The dog is half-starved, with matted, damp fur that suggests it\u2019s been chained out here for quite some time. A few puddles provide it with water, but you can see no food anywhere within the reach of its chain. You wonder why its owners did not set it free before leaving. Perhaps they didn\u2019t have the chance.\nThe dog snaps angrily at you from the end of his chain!\n#User: unlock the chain\n#Game:As you approach the dog, he snarls and snaps at you, perhaps hoping that your fingers will serve to ease his hunger.\nThe dog growls at you!\n#User: E\n#Game:Inside Hut\nYou stand in a small hut. Whoever lived here left in a great hurry; the shelves are in disarray, many things are missing, and there are muddy footprints everywhere. What little food does remain is all carefully preserved\u2014clearly, the owner expected to have to make a long journey soon.\nThere is a piece of dried beef here.\nExits lie west.\n#User: take beef and leave\n#Game:Taken.\nRoad Near Hut\nThere is a mangy dog here.\nExits lie east and north.\nThe dog sniffs the air and barks at you.\n#User: give beef to dog\n#Game:You toss the piece of beef so that it lies at the dog\u2019s feet. He gulps it down rapidly and whines in relief. It wags its tail at you excitedly.\n#User: unlock chain\n#Game:You unlock the chain from around the dog\u2019s neck, and it bounds free.\n#User: N\n#Game:The dog follows you.\nRoad To Castle\nYou are on a steep path that leads up the mountain to the castle of the evil Zorkathra, just below the ridge that marks the crest of the mountains. Beyond this point, there is no turning back; you remain out of sight of her mindless thralls for only a short distance longer. Any further, and her gate sentry will spot you.\nThere is a mangy dog here.\nExits lie north and south.\n#User: N\n#Game:The dog follows you.\nCastle Entrance\nYou are at the entrance to the castle of the sinister sorceress, Zorkathra. The gates lie wide open; a spellcaster as powerful as Zorkathra needs no mortal defenses. Indeed, she invites adventurers to attempt to defeat her, knowing that every bold hero might provide her with momentary amusement.\nThere is a sentry here.\nThere is a mangy dog here.\nExits lie north and south.\nThe sentry spots you, and unsheathes its sword.\n#User: look at the sentry\n#Game:The sentry stands tall in black armor. Dull red eyes glow from behind its visor. A demon bound to the armor? A fallen paladin? Or something else? It's impossible to tell with its helmet on.\nThe sentry charges at you!\n#User: fight sentry\n#Game:You ball up your fists and swing at the sentry. It ignores your feeble blows as they bounce off its dark armor.\nThe dog growls and bites at the sentry's heels.\n#User:use wand\n#Game:You raise your father's wand, but the sentry is too close! Even with the dog distracting it, it manages to knock the wand out of your hands!\nThe dog continues to try and defend you.\n#User:pick up wand\n#Game:You bend over to pick up the wand... and only realize your mistake as the sentry's sword swings down in an overhead chop that ends your adventure with one fell swoop.\nDo you wish to restart?\n#User: yes",
