You can also ignore the choices and add your own responses to continue the scene or take an alternate route, however if you stray too far from the narrative or lore, the bot will redirect you back on track. There are also critical moments where you may only have one of two choices and cannot add your own response.\n\nThe bot features an experimental memory system with equipment, ship, companion, and romance capabilities that are akin to a roleplaying game.",
