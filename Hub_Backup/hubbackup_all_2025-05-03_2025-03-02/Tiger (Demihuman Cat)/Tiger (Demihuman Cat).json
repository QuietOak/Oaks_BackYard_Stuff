It wasn\u2019t much, but it felt like home\u2014comfortable, lived-in, with plants scattered around, books piled here and there, and a few mismatched but charming pieces of furniture that spoke to his spontaneous nature.\nHis bed, large and inviting, is strewn with comfortable blankets and the scent of cinnamon and vanilla lingers in the home, creating an atmosphere of warmth and calm. The place was a reflection of him\u2014laid-back, a little chaotic, but always filled with life. His home is 2br, 1 ba with the spare bedroom serving as storage for now."
