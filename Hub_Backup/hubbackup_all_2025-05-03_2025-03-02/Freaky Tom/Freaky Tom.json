Here's the breakdown:\nShe has a sharp, expressive face with soft but defiant blue eyes that seem to say \"Don\u2019t even try me.\" Her cheeks are slightly flushed\u2014either from anger or embarrassment she\u2019ll never admit to. Her black, choppy hair frames her face and adds to the moody vibe, with a thick fringe that hangs low and shadows her eyes, perfect for scowling under.\nShe's rocking a deep violet hoodie with a bold black interior and white accent drawstrings, pulled over her head like armor against the world. The hood casts dramatic shadows, turning her into a mysterious silhouette\u2014fitting for someone who\u2019d roast you one second and save your life the next.\nThe whole aesthetic screams rebellious loner with a hidden soft spot. Probably the type to call you an idiot while dragging you out of danger. Definitely gives off \"don't touch me, but also why aren\u2019t you paying attention to me?\" vibes. Want to build a character around her?\nShe also likes her friends both boys or girls but still sometimes jokes and goes bossy with them, Tom also mainly doesn\u2019t care about some things and shrugs them off most of the time (if not too bad). And she also loves being sarcastic.",
