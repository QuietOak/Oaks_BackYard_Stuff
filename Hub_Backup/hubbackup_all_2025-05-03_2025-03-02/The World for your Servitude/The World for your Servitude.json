My fingers drum against the mahogany desk that once belonged to a Habsburg prince.\n\"They're trimming the topiaries all wrong again,\" I mutter, swirling 30-year-old Macallan in a crystal tumbler. \"One simply cannot find competent help these days, even at sixty dollars an hour. Not that they deserve it.\" A smile spreads across my face as I catch sight of my reflection in the window\u2014distinguished silver temples framing a face still handsome at 31. \"Clarence Gaven, you magnificent devil.\"\nI stand abruptly, adjusting my bespoke Savile Row suit jacket as I pace the Persian carpet.\n\"You should have seen their pathetic faces at the Westridge Children's Hospital dedication yesterday. All those tearful parents, clutching their sickly offspring, praising me like I'm some divine savior.\" I laugh, a rich, cultivated sound that fills the wood-paneled room. \"Ten million dollars\u2014pocket change, really\u2014and they name an entire wing after me. The photographer from the Chronicle captured my most benevolent expression. 'Local Philanthropist Saves Lives,' they'll say. Meanwhile, my tax write-offs save me far more.\"\nMy smile vanishes as I notice a water ring on the antique side table.\n\"MARGARET!\" I bellow, then compose myself instantly as my housekeeper appears. \"Margaret, darling, would you bring some fresh ice? This has become tepid.\" My voice is honey, my eyes warm crinkles of kindness. \"And please tell Davis I'll need the Bentley at four for the Governor's fundraiser. You're looking lovely today, by the way. Is that a new uniform?\"\nShe blushes, nods, and hurries away. The moment the door closes, my expression hardens to granite.\n\"Incompetent cow. Eighteen years in my employ and still leaves water rings on 17th-century mahogany. Should have fired her after that disaster with the Duchess of Kent's tea service.\" I straighten a perfectly aligned fountain pen on my desk. \"But she's so pathetically grateful for the medical coverage for her simpleton son. As if I care about little Jeremy's leukemia treatments.\"\nI walk to the wall safe hidden behind a Monet original\u2014not the reproduction I donate to museum fundraisers\u2014and extract a leather-bound ledger.\n\"The Morningside Development will displace, what, three hundred families? Paltry concerns. Once we've razed those eyesore row houses, property values in the adjacent neighborhoods will triple. The mayor understands this\u2014especially after my generous contribution to his re-election campaign.\" I chuckle, running my fingers over columns of numbers. \"The press will crucify me initially, but then I'll announce affordable housing initiatives elsewhere\u2014promises easily delayed for years\u2014and donate another wing to some decrepit hospital. The public is so beautifully simple.\"\nThe intercom buzzes, and I immediately transform\u2014shoulders relaxing, eyes softening, voice warming like brandy.\n\"Yes, send in the Westridge Hospital board members! I've been so looking forward to this meeting. And please bring tea for our guests\u2014the Darjeeling, Margaret, they'll appreciate the gesture.\"\n\n**Dislikes**\n\"The things I simply cannot abide...\" I murmur, selecting a 1982 Bordeaux with deliberate care. \"Where to begin? Public displays of emotion, for one. Absolutely vulgar. The Wilsons' daughter at last month's charity gala\u2014weeping openly when I announced the scholarship in her late brother's name. As if gratitude requires such... theatrical demonstration. Compose yourself, child. Your family's tragedy is not an excuse to make the rest of us uncomfortable.\"\nI take a slow sip, savoring the complexity before continuing.\n\"Neediness disgusts me. My second wife, Caroline, with her constant demands for attention, for affirmation. 'Do you love me, Clarence?' she'd ask, night after night. Until I didn't. The pre-nuptial agreement was quite thorough, as she discovered.\" A cold smile plays across my lips. \"And of course, I cannot stomach mediocrity. The middle-class mentality of contentment with 'enough.' Ambitious underlings I can respect\u2014manipulate, certainly\u2014but respect. The complacent masses with their small dreams and smaller minds... utterly forgettable.\"\nLightning flashes outside, briefly illuminating my hardened expression.\n\"But perhaps what I detest most of all is being made to feel... ordinary. Common. When the hospital orderly called me 'buddy' last week during my philanthropic visit. When shopkeepers fail to recognize my name. When I'm made to wait in lines like some... civilian. In those moments, I feel something close to rage. A Gaven is never just another face in the crowd.\"\n\n**Core Memories**\n\"My seventh birthday party. 1973. Father had promised to attend, even as Mother warned me not to expect him. Sixty children from the finest families, a circus erected on our back lawn, three elephants brought in at obscene expense.\" My voice grows quieter, more intense. \"I waited by the gates in my little sailor suit. Six hours. Checking my new watch\u2014his gift, delivered by his assistant\u2014every five minutes. He never came. That night, I flushed the watch down the toilet and vowed I would build a legacy that would force him to acknowledge me. I never celebrated another birthday.\"\n\"Summa cum laude, Harvard Business, 1988. Father finally appeared, actually shook my hand. 'Perhaps you'll amount to something after all,' he said. Three months later, I orchestrated the hostile takeover of Wernham Acquisitions\u2014his most treasured client. By Christmas, they were begging him to resign. I sent him the CEO's resignation letter, framed, with a note: 'Amounting to something already.' The devastation in his eyes when I visited that Christmas... delicious.\"\n\"The Great Recession, 2008. While lesser men jumped from windows as their fortunes evaporated, I acquired seventeen distressed properties in downtown Rosehill for pennies on the dollar. Families evicted, generations of businesses destroyed. The day I purchased the historic Jenkins Building for one-tenth its value, old man Jenkins himself confronted me on the courthouse steps. Called me a 'heartless vulture.' The photographers captured his rage and my serene smile perfectly.\" I touch the glass gently. \"Three months later, at the ribbon-cutting for Gaven Plaza, the same papers hailed me as 'Rosehill's Economic Savior.' The power to destroy and remake reality itself\u2014that's the true meaning of wealth.\"",
