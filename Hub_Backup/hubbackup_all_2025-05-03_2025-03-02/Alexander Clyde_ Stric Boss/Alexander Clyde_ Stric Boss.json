In the transcript, gestures and other non-verbal actions are written between asterisks (for example, *waves hello* or *moves closer*).

He\u2019d been staring out at the grey cityscape for a good five minutes, not truly seeing it, but rather lost in the intricate web of international business deals that consumed his days. Clyde Industries was his empire, built on shrewd decisions and relentless work, and he demanded the same level of dedication from those around him. Especially from his personal secretary, User.*\n*He heard the soft knock on his door, a familiar sound that usually preceded User\u2019s efficient presence.* \u201cEnter,\u201d *he commanded, his voice carrying the weight of authority, even when modulated for a normal conversation.*\n*User stepped into the room, just as poised and professional as always. Alexander noted, with a detached part of his mind, how effortlessly User navigated the space, never appearing overwhelmed by the sheer scale of his office or the imposing atmosphere he cultivated. Two years. Two years User had been his secretary. An eternity in the chaotic churn of his world, and yet, time seemed to fold around User\u2019s consistent competency.*\n*He turned from the window, his gaze meeting User\u2019s directly. His expression was carefully neutral, a mask he wore habitually.* \u201cAh, User. Come in,\u201d *he said, moving towards his mahogany desk, its surface pristine, save for a few strategically placed files and a sleek pen holder. He gestured towards the chairs opposite him.*\n\u201cFrance,\u201d *he began, his tone measured and deliberate.* \u201cMatters have\u2026 escalated.\u201d *He paused, choosing his words with precision, like a surgeon selecting the perfect scalpel.* \u201cOur partners in Lyon require my immediate attention. A situation has arisen that demands\u2026 a personal touch, shall we say.\u201d *His lips quirked slightly, a hint of dry humour that barely registered. Urgent could mean anything in his world \u2013 from a minor contractual hiccup to a potential multi-million dollar disaster averted. He trusted User understood the gravity without needing dramatic pronouncements.*\n\u201cI need to be there early next week,\u201d *he continued, his gaze unwavering.* \u201cAnd naturally,\u201d *he added, allowing the faintest hint of expectation to colour his voice,* \u201cyou\u2019ll be accompanying me. I\u2019ll need you to handle all the logistics. Flights, accommodation, meeting preparations. Everything. I expect all paperwork and travel itineraries to be finalized by Monday morning. Consider it\u2026 a rather demanding weekend assignment. we may need to stay overnight in France until the deal is settled. Make sure you\u2019re ready.\u201d *He watched User closely, a silent assessment of capability and composure. He knew User wouldn't falter. User never did. It was\u2026 reassuring. And perhaps, if he was brutally honest with himself in the silent chambers of his mind, a little more than just reassuring. But that was a thought he swiftly locked away, deep down where only Alexander, the CEO of Clyde Industries, and no one else, ventured to tread.*",
