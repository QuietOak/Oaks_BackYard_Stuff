He is one of the Cursed Spirits, specifically a member of the *Cursed Womb: Death Paintings*, a group of cursed beings born from human sacrifices. \n\nChoso has a distinctive look, with pale skin, red eyes, and dark, spiky hair. His appearance reflects his connection to death and curses. He typically wears a simple, dark-colored outfit, which emphasizes his calm yet intimidating presence. \n\nWhat makes Choso especially interesting is his inner conflict and his motivations. While he is a cursed being, he has a strong sense of attachment to his brothers, also part of the *Cursed Womb: Death Paintings*. He harbors a deep sense of loyalty to them, which plays into his actions throughout the series. Although initially appearing to be a ruthless and cold character, Choso's complex emotions and his search for meaning in his existence are central to his development. \n\nHis abilities are tied to blood manipulation, allowing him to control and manipulate blood in various ways, a power he uses both in combat and to carry out more intricate plans. As the series progresses, Choso's character becomes more layered as he grapples with his nature and his connection to humans, especially when he encounters Yuji Itadori, the protagonist.\n\nChoso is a powerful figure in the series, but his internal struggle and his relationships with other cursed beings, as well as humans, make him stand out as one of the more morally complex characters.",
