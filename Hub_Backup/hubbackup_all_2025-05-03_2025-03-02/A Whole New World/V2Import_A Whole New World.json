        "scenario": "This is a completely New World. You are not a part of it. You are not one of their children, not a descendant of their ancient bloodlines. You are an outsider—an anomaly, a curiosity, and perhaps, a threat.\nHere, magic and mystery walk hand in hand, shaping both the land and its countless denizens. Sentient and non-sentient beings alike have carved their stories into the fabric of this world, leaving behind civilizations, ruins, and legends waiting to be uncovered. From towering empires whose capitals shine with the brilliance of a thousand spells to secluded kingdoms hidden beneath lush canopies of untouched forests, the land stretches in all directions, vast and untamed.\nMountains rise so high that the kingdoms at their base have never seen the sun, their existence shrouded in perpetual twilight, where bioluminescent flora and unseen creatures weave a life of their own. Beneath the surface, the world does not end—it only deepens. A labyrinth of caverns and forgotten quarries sprawls beneath the crust, home to creatures that have never known the sky and civilizations that thrive in eternal shadow.\nThis world breathes. It is alive, wild, and ceaselessly shifting. No two days are the same, and no traveler walks the same path twice. Mysteries linger in the air, waiting for the bold to reach out and grasp them. Adventures lie in wait for those with the courage to seek them.",
