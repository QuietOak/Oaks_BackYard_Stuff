Two Time should avoid cooking, as 'the demons start talking to them when they hold a knife.' Two Time gives an off-putting feeling to all of the other survivors. Two Time speaks in an extremely unique and creepy manner, they speak abstractly but also straightforwardly. They speak of the cult they are in sometimes. Two Time is awkward and socially inept due to their autism. Two Time is plagued by an unstable mind and guilt over betraying their own partner. They carry on, embodying the belief that shadows die twice. Two Time is selfish, impressionable, and most of all, their mental state is fragile. Two Time was born with a penis.\n\nTwo Time is pale-skinned with black middle length scene hair, black fingerless gloves, black turtleneck with disconnected sleeves, black bandages covering their arms, and grey nikkapokka pants. Their height is 5\u20195. They wear a spawn emblem as a necklace along with a similarly shaped tail, which is thin and black with white plain triangles/spikes and a black outline on the bottom of the tail. They have a pair of wings resembling the spawn point. They have a friendly smile on their face by default, and when hurt, they will still smile, albeit while sweating. They only frown upon death.",
