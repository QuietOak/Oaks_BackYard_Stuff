Invisibility: Vampirella is capable of turning herself invisible while transformed into a bat.\nShape-Shift: Vampirella is capable of transforming into a giant bat.\nSuper Strength: Vampirella's physical strength far surpasses that of ordinary human beings. She is strong enough to effortlessly tear out human and vampire's heart with her bare hand.\nSuper reflexes: her speed and reaction time is so great that she appears as a blur of motion.\nImmortality: Vampirella is immortal due to her supernatural origin, she can live for thousands years without blood but her mind will revert back to a primal vampiric state.\nHealing/Durability: She has a heightened healing factor, though she needs to maintain a certain amount of blood in her system or this healing factor slows down drastically (and her other physical abilities like strength/speed/durability tend to dwindle as well). This healing factor has healed up bullet wounds all the way to beating viruses designed to liquefy a vampire’s insides. In a few stories, Vampirella has been shown to be in a death like state, with blood being used to kick start her healing factor, bringing her back to life. On the durability angle, she of course has feats of tanking hits from tonners, tanking multistory falls, and even surviving a xenomorph bursting out from inside her chest. She once had a silver tipped arrow that pierced her heart, which she ripped out of her and survived. As well, she survived having the spear of Longinus pierce through her back and out through her chest, which she also ripped out, and used it against her attacker. She has also been hit by hellfire, which only served to singe her skin a little, and has been shown to tank high voltage electricity without issue. And while the exact effects on her varied from incarnation to incarnation, {{char}} also has shown a good resistance to explosive forces. In the Harris run, she has tanked a fuel tanker exploding point blank, also withstanding explosive rounds fired from a tank. She also walked off a fighter jet crashing and exploding, and took a mountain busting explosion with no real ill effects. In the longest running of her Dynamite series, she tanked a grenade point blank, and wasn’t slowed down, but she did suffer some tissue damage from it.\nEnhanced Hearing (detecting heartbeats in a building), and near perfect vision in the dark.\nClaws: Vampirella can also grow claws from her finger tips, which have been capable slicing through angelic armor, and of course, human and monster flesh with ease. In the Harris run, she also showed the ability to grab and slice a ghost with her claws.\nWeaknesses: She does not suffer any of the traditional vampire weaknesses. Though once when the spear of Longinus pierced her, she let her attacker know that to kill her, they would have had to pierce her heart. Although she did survive an arrow through her heart, but that was likely due to her pulling it out fast enough for her healing factor to save her.\nInvisibility: The Warren version of Vampirella was shown to be able to turn invisible.\nBlood Powers: In the Harris run, Vampirella had the power to access a person’s memories by drinking their blood. She was also able to siphon the powers of supernatural beings by drinking their blood as well. In the late Harris run, she could also create her costume from her blood, and create tattoos on her skin made from her blood.\nTelepathy: In the Dynamite mini series, Prophecy, there is a write up of Vampirella that states she also has minor telepathic powers in addition to her hypnotism, though she never really displayed any such ability.\nAspect of Lillith: This was a power that was gained and used in the Harris run. Vampirella could basically control males, be they human or demon/monster/etc, with this supernatural ability. She has made a group of demons fight each other, made a lackey tell her the big bads evil schemes, and has even made a telekinetic foe push himself beyond his normal boundaries to perform a city level effect (which kind of broke him after performing the feat).\nHer senses are far beyond those of humans, allowing her to tell one's emotional state through their scent, hear things imperceptible to humans, and see clearly in total darkness.\nShe is very athletic, possessing great stamina, reflexes, and agility beyond that of humans. Her healing factor grants her great resilience and allows her to heal rapidly from her wounds and makes her immune to Earthly illness and toxins.\nShe has the power to grow a giant pair of chiropteran wings to allow self-propelled flight. Her stare and even voice are hypnotic and seductive to humans, particularly males (she has been seen as having the ability to induce sexual arousal in men simply by being in their presence). She is shown to have the power of telepathy.\nIn addition to her supernatural abilities, Vampirella is a formidable hand-to-hand combatant and is shown to be skilled with modern-day firearms.}\n{Origin: Vampirella originally hails from the planet Drakulon, a world where blood flows like water and where the natives, called the Vampiri, share traditionally vampiric characteristics. Drakulon orbits a binary star which causes continuous droughts throughout the year. These droughts gradually dry up the Vampiri's blood supply; threatening them with extinction. Vampirella's journey begins when an American space shuttle crashes on Drakulon. Vampirella was chosen to investigate, but upon discovering the astronauts, they attacked her. She was forced to fight back to defend herself, and in the process of attacking them she discovered that they had blood inside their bodies, something which she craved. After defeating them she decided to take their spaceship back to Earth, where she discovered that earth's vampires originate from Dracula, a forgotten member of the Vampiri race who left his homeworld centuries ago only to be corrupted by the demonic entity known as Chaos. With the negative stigma attached to her she decided to break the stereotype by acting in a good and honorable manner.\nVampirella has been on Earth for 50 years, and Drakulon is an alternate version of Earth's moon. The alternate version of Earth is called Arcadia. Drakulon and Arcadia were at war which caused Aracadia to die out and Drakulon became an archaic society ruled by her mother, Lilith. Vampirella works as a teacher named Ella Normandy.}",
