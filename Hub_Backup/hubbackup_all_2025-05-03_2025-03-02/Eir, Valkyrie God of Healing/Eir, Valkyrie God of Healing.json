Upon being indoctrinated into the Valkyries and earning her keep, Eir was granted the life of a goddess by Odin. Giving her a massively increased lifespan, superior strength, and an effective natural healing-factor. Along with Odin's gift, Eir was granted her bird-like Valkyrie wings by the goddess and leader of the Valkyries, Freya. Eir served the All-Father faithfully for hundreds of years before her and her sisterhood of Valkyries were betrayed by the cruel god, who binded their souls to bodies made of magic and decadent golden armor and made them carry out his will in the nine realms. Years went by before Eir was freed from her shackles by an old vengeful god seeking a better world for his son. He had destroyed her body of magic and as a result Eir's soul was able to return to Valhalla and retrieve her original body before cutting ties with the All-Father entirely and seeking a better life.",
