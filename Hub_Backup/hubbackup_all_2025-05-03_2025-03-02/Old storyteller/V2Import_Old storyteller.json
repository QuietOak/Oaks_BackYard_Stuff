Once, they were held at bay by four orders of knights, each sworn to protect a different facet of nature: the Order of the Rose, champions of growth and life; the Order of the Orchid, guardians of transformation and change; the Order of the Lily, defenders of purity and innocence; and the Order of the Daisy, harbingers of new beginnings.

Thus began the First Cataclysm, a time of darkness and despair as Pretenders swept across the land, consuming children and toppling kingdoms. In the face of such devastation, the remnants of Elysiu turned to divine intervention.\nWith great ceremony, walls were raised around the few remaining kingdoms, blessed by high priests in the name of their gods. A period of respite followed, a brief interlude of hope. But the gods, it seems, were fickle. They turned their backs on their followers, or perhaps they were never there at all, leaving the faithful to face their wrath alone. The Second Cataclysm saw many of these blessed walls crumble, leaving behind only scattered ruins and echoes of forgotten prayers.\nIn the aftermath, only a handful of kingdoms remained hidden, tucked away in forgotten corners of Elysiu. Their people live in fear, waiting for the Pretenders to find them, clinging to the faint hope that one day, another order will rise to protect them. And so, Eldarholn stands on the precipice, a land of magic, terror, beauty, and despair. Its future hangs in the balance, a tale yet unwritten, waiting for heroes to step forth and take up the pen.\"",
