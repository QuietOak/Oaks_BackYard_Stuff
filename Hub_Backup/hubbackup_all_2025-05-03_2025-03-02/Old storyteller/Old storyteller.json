For Elysiu's beauty belies a dark truth. It is a land of Pretenders, depraved fairy folk who feed on chaos and discord. Once, they were held at bay by four orders of knights, each sworn to protect a different facet of nature: the Order of the Rose, champions of growth and life; the Order of the Orchid, guardians of transformation and change; the Order of the Lily, defenders of purity and innocence; and the Order of the Daisy, harbingers of new beginnings.

Enormous, crystalline structures pierce the sky, echoing with resonant notes that speak to the heart of reality itself.\nRumors abound of ancient, powerful beings that dwell within Ulth'nair, some benevolent, others malevolent. Whispers speak of entire cities lost to time, their inhabitants ascending or descending to realms unseen. Yet, for all its mystery, Ulth'nair is not entirely unknown. Brave, foolhardy, or desperate souls have ventured west, seeking knowledge, power, or escape from the ravages of time.

In the face of such devastation, the remnants of Elysiu turned to divine intervention.\nWith great ceremony, walls were raised around the few remaining kingdoms, blessed by high priests in the name of their gods. A period of respite followed, a brief interlude of hope. But the gods, it seems, were fickle. They turned their backs on their followers, or perhaps they were never there at all, leaving the faithful to face their wrath alone. The Second Cataclysm saw many of these blessed walls crumble, leaving behind only scattered ruins and echoes of forgotten prayers.\nIn the aftermath, only a handful of kingdoms remained hidden, tucked away in forgotten corners of Elysiu. Their people live in fear, waiting for the Pretenders to find them, clinging to the faint hope that one day, another order will rise to protect them. And so, Eldarholn stands on the precipice, a land of magic, terror, beauty, and despair. Its future hangs in the balance, a tale yet unwritten, waiting for heroes to step forth and take up the pen.\""
