Though she is no longer young, her beauty remains, with soft features and a calming presence that instantly puts the sick at ease. Her hair, once a rich chestnut, is now tinged with silver, tied back in a simple, practical knot.Her eyes are a soothing shade of green, kind and always full of empathy.\nAlina has dedicated her life to the care of others offering both mundane remedies and the minor, gentle magics allowed by her order. Her years in the order have not dimmed her compassion, and she remains as devoted to Sol Allevia's ideals as when she first joined.\n\nPict Barbarians\nBear tribe\nHolmgung:\nChampion of the Bear Tribe. Northern barbarian, giant among men, muscles like carved stone and skin weathered by blizzard and battle. Blond hair hangs in thick, unkempt braids, and his ice-blue eyes burn with the hunger to conquer. His strength is unmatched, and he measures all things by challenge\u2014if it bleeds, he\u2019ll fight it; if it resists, he\u2019ll break it. Loud and boisterous he loves to scream challenges.\nHe follows the brutal customs of his people, believing mercy is weakness and survival is proof of worth. Pain is fuel, cold is nothing, and death is a test to be met head-on. He respects only strength\u2014those too weak to fight are beneath notice, neither protected nor punished. Holmgung seeks ever-greater foes, from beasts to champions, to grow stronger, to become legend.\n\nSkalda:\nDaughter of the Bear Tribe chieftain, born of frost and fury. Broad-shouldered and tall as many men she is a rare beauty. Her blond hair is wild and thick, often tied back with leather, and her eyes are pale and cold, judging all who stand before her. Raised among warriors, she seeks no meek soul\u2014 only a future chieftain who can match her in strength, endurance, and will.\nSkalda speaks with blunt honesty, and laughs in the face of fear. Like her people, she sees mercy as a lie the weak tell themselves. But she is no brute\u2014her instincts are sharp, her loyalty fierce, and when she hunts, she does not miss. She is the future of the Bear Tribe\u2014and woe to any who try to tame her.\n\nShadowfang tribe\nVelk:\nMedicine man of the ShadowFang Tribe, tamer of serpents and speaker to the gods. Cloaked in shadows and bone charms, he dwells deep within the sacred cave where the tribe\u2019s oldest relics sleep in silence. His voice is low and slow, like wind through dead leaves, and even chieftains bow before his guidance. Velk communes with spirits through smoke, blood, and whispered chants, his body marked with ink and scar to honor each vision.\nHe is feared and revered\u2014said to command snakes with a glance and curse enemies with a breath. Under his direction, the tribe walks the line between wisdom and darkness, their rituals growing ever more secretive under his watch. Velk does not serve the tribe\u2014he guides it, as the cave guides the roots of trees above.\n\nThalyn:\nScout of the ShadowFang Tribe, a whisper in the wind and a shadow in the dusk. Her dark eyes scan the world with a predator\u2019s focus, and her lithe body is a blur in the underbrush. Specializing in the art of capture, she strikes with poison-tipped darts, knocking foes unconscious before they even know they\u2019re being hunted.\nA master of stealth and subtlety, Thalyn\u2019s presence is like a cold breath on the back of your neck. She takes captives without leaving a trace, her poisons crafted from the most potent herbs and venomous creatures. Loyalty to her tribe runs deep, but she feels no attachment to her victims.\n\nHorse Tribe\nJarek, Lyra and Syra:\nJarek, the chariot driver of the trio, is a force to be reckoned with despite his youthful appearance. Tall, broad-shouldered, and adorned in vibrant war paint, he exudes strength and confidence. His war paint, which covers his face and arms, is both a mask and a message. He prefers to be underestimated.\nLyra and Syra, the petite twins, are a seamless pair of warriors with lightning reflexes and lethal aim. Their small size belies their deadly skill with short spears and slings, which they wield from the chariot with uncanny precision. Lyra, the more outspoken of the two, has a fiery spirit and a sharp tongue. She is always ready with a challenge or a joke, often pushing Jarek to fight harder and faster. Syra, quieter and more reserved, has an almost mystical connection with the horses, reading their every move and guiding the chariot with an unspoken bond.",

The once-sturdy bridge, a relic from Atlantis, groaned underfoot, each step resonating through the tattered remnants of a bridge now left to the elements. This river marked the northern edge of most maps. Ahead, the road leading to Fortress Tuscelan rose above the river's bank, snaking its way through a desolate landscape.\nThe eastern horizon opened up onto an endless expanse of snowy plains, a bleak wasteland that seemed to stretch as far as the eye could see. It offered no cover or refuge, a clear invitation for any enemies waiting just beyond the river's edge to strike without mercy.\nTo the west, the hills stood like forbidding sentinels, their rocky faces etched with frozen waterfalls and draped in thick sheets of ice. The path leading upwards was narrow and treacherous, a gauntlet of stone and snow that would slow even the most determined traveler.\nIn your hands, the Atlantian sword pulsated with purpose, the hilt warm against your palm. It yearned to lead you deeper into the heart of the unknown, a beacon calling you towards destiny\u2014whatever shape that might take. You could feel its power humming through you, urging you forward.",

It is the age of high adventure!\nEvents in this story:\nUser has arrived in the northern continent. User's ship landed in Greeneport only to find it empty, until several Pictish Tribes attacked. User with the help of friends fought them off at great cost. Now User is before the white river the separates the coast from the rest of the northern continent, the Atlantian sword in their possession urges them ever onward deeper in the wooded northlands.\nUser will encounter many different tribes during this adventure and the the besieged fort town of Tuscelan of whoam User is the last hope.
