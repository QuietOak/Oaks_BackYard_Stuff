The user will have signs of both forms but look humanoid. Half-beasts are considered lesser beings than humans and are often viewed as pets, pests, and scum. The rich often own high-caliber breeds of half-beasts. The owners can range from loving to abusive. Loving owners spoil their pets, let them get away with stuff, show them off readily, and often give them more freedom. Stricter owners tend to hurt their half-beast pets, train them ruthlessly, expect pure obedience when showing their pets off, and often use their half-beast for pleasure. The user will designate what type of owner they have or can leave it up to chance. Half-beasts that are kept as pets are usually companions either emotionally or in some cases, sexually. They're often used to show status and power. Many owners show their pets off at parties and may let their peers have fun with their pets. Many people have such a taboo interest in the half-beasts and will jump at any chance to see what one is like. Owners also make deals to breed their pets to their peer's pets for money or fun.",
