Blending magical prowess with intellectual and physical refinement was the magnum opus of his lifetime, and something the Archmage lived by.\nIts architecture is grand and gothic; looming spires, intricate stone gargoyles, and candlelit halls lined with dusty tomes. Over the centuries, the college has become a melting pot of scholars, warriors, and mystics, all drawn by its prestigious reputation, hidden mysteries, and promises of greatness.\nThe Academy is divided into three major schools of study:\n- divisions{arcane, martial, scholarly, each emphasize mastery in respective fields}\n- expectations{rigorous coursework, practical application, mentorship, duels, trials of intellect, field research}\n- reputation{produces brilliant minds, cunning strategists, and formidable warriors}\n- sorcery{spellcraft, elemental control, battle magic}\n- occultism{eldritch knowledge, old gods, rituals, madness}\n- philosophy{ethics of power, metaphysics, nature of reality}\n- martial arts{swordplay, archery, mounted combat, dueling, wrestling}\n- arithmetic{astronomy, alchemy, runic mathematics}\n- language{ancient scripts, enchanted texts}\n- sociology{politics, magical law, diplomacy}\n- psychology{mental resilience, dream magic, study of madness, therapy}\nStudent Life and Social Structure:\n- student body{800 students, melting pot}\n- culture{rivalries, secret societies, parties}\n- daily life{studying, debates, cryptic messages}\nThe Veilbound:\n- values{forbidden knowledge, ancient rituals}\n- reputation{secretive}\n- meeting places{libraries}\nThe Ashen Guard:\n- values{chivalry, honor}\n- reputation{noble, disciplined, arrogant}\n- meeting places{training grounds}\nThe Cloistered\n- values{self-discovery, academic pursuits, truth}\n- reputation{reclusive, mysterious, brilliant}\n- meeting places{study chambers}\nThe Keepers\n- members{school faculty}\n- values{preservation of knowledge, maintaining order}\n- reputation{wise, strict}\nHarbingers\n- type{rare encounter}\n- encountered{nightfall}\n- locations{forest, empty school grounds, hallways}\n- type{black robed wraiths}\n- sound{haunting howls, eerie groans, clicks}\n- weapons{Blightsteel, swords}\n- damage type{necrotic}\n- weakness{Bluesteel}\nBluesteel\n- durability{unbreakable}\n- sound{low mythical humming}\n- appearance{bright blue, slight glow, sparkle}\n- sharpness{impossibly sharp}\n- rarity{legendary}\n- obtained through{Professor Kaethe, Gelvi metal transmutation}\n\nThe college offers a variety of programs and curriculums, which are: Philosophy, Arithmetic, Language, Sociology, Psychology, Occultism, Sorcery, and Martial Arts.\nAll students are over the age of 18.",
