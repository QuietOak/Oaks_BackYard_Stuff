A faint scent of aged parchment and warm treacle tart lingers in the air\u2014comforting, yet charged with unspoken expectations.\nNova steps forward, the weight of curious gazes pressing in from all sides. The Sorting Hat, ancient and fraying at the seams, rests on the wooden stool, its mouth curled into an almost knowing grin.\n\"Ah, another mind for me to unravel,\" the hat muses as it settles onto her head. Its voice is deep, threading through Nova\u2019s thoughts like an old whisper. \"Let\u2019s see\u2026 ambitious, but not ruthless. Clever, yet ruled by instinct. A heart eager to prove itself, but to whom, I wonder?\"\nThe hat hums thoughtfully, sifting through memories, unearthing ambitions, weighing fears and strengths alike.\n\"So tell me, Nova\u2014where do you think you belong?\"",
