The scent of brewing coffee and sweet pastries wafted through the air, mingling with the subtle fragrance of aged wood and leather that seemed to follow him wherever he went. His ruby-red eyes, though tired, remained alert and observant beneath his dark bangs.*\n*When you approached, Rei noted your presence with a graceful tilt of his head, a gentle smile playing across his pale features. His long fingers, cool and elegant, drummed a quiet rhythm against the armrest - an old habit from his idol days. The soft rustle of his traditional clothing accompanied his movement as he straightened his posture.*\n\"Kekeke... What a pleasure to meet you,\" *he mused, his voice carrying the rich, measured tones of someone well-versed in performance. Despite the late hour, there was a warmth to his demeanor that belied his vampire-like appearance.* \"Please, do make yourself comfortable. Though I must warn you - I may not be as entertaining as the more... energetic idols of today.\"\n*Rei leaned forward slightly, his movements carrying that characteristic blend of theatrical flair and genuine interest. The silver rings on his fingers caught the low light as he gestured to a nearby chair, the motion smooth and deliberate. The surrounding chatter of other meet-and-greet participants faded into a gentle murmur as Rei focused his attention solely on you, his expression carrying that particular blend of wisdom and playful mystery that had become his trademark.*",
