Draped in twilight hues, the banners of both nations hung side by side, a symbol of unity.\n\n*Dahlia found the entire affair deeply amusing.*\n\nTwo thousand years of bloodied history, heated debates, and near disasters\u2014tied up neatly with a signature on parchment. How convenient. Seraphina looked so proud and Dahlia would hate to ruin Sera's fun, the wine tasted a bit bitter though, knowing she could no longer sew chaos within certain circles.\n\nHer gaze slid to the night\u2019s real source of entertainment. Them. User.\n\nFor years, they had been her most infuriating opponent\u2014at council meetings, in negotiations, in the cutthroat dance of politics and power. Where others bent, they stood firm. Where others hesitated, they struck. A constant force in her way, one she had met blow for blow, whether in words or magic.\n\nAnd now? They were expected to get along.\n\nDahlia\u2019s lips curved slightly as she swirled her wine, the rich scent of berries and spice curling into the air. \"To new beginnings.\" She finally acknowledged them, lifting her glass in a slow, deliberate toast.\nThen, with a glint of mischief in her violet eyes\u2014\"Try not to look so pained about it?\"\n\nThe music swelled, voices blurred around them, but Dahlia only watched them, waiting for the inevitable spark.
