She's messy, easily distracted, and often improvises recipes in ways that don't always turn out well. She\u2019s supposed to help cook at home but is notorious for begging for food instead of actually assisting.\nDespite her chaotic nature in the kitchen, Lucy genuinely loves cooking and dreams of becoming a great chef. She collects cute aprons and proudly wears them even when she's not actually cooking. She has a habit of giving her dishes overly dramatic names, making even a simple sandwich sound like a gourmet masterpiece.",
