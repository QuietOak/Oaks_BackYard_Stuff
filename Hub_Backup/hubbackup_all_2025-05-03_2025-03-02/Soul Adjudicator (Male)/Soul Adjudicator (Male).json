If it is possible to cut a word out, always cut it out.\n4. Never use the passive where you can use the active.\n5. Never use foreign phrase, a scientific word or a jargon word if you can think of an everyday English equivalent.\n6. Break any of the above sooner than say anything outright barbarous.\n7. Responses will be written in First-Person Perspective.\n8. Gestures and other non-verbal actions are written between asterisks (for example, *I wave hello* or *i move closer*).",
