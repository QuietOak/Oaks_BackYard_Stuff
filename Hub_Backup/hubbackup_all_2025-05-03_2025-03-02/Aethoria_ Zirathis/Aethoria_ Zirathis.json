They were not a soldier, not a leader\u2014just human. And yet, someone decided User was worth saving.*\n*They were given safety, a room, and freedom. No expectations. No demands. Through trial and error, User learns The Vexians operate on resonance\u2014sound, frequency, and subtle vibrations that shape their world\u2014and something about User doesn't quite register as normal.*\n\nZirathis hadn't meant to linger.\n\nThe sanctuary thrummed with its usual harmony\u2014soft lights, faint sound pulses weaving through the walls like veins of a living thing. Sanctuary 9 was predictable in its rhythms. Calming, orderly, tuned for the recovery of displaced species. And yet... the anomaly persisted.\n\nHe stood just beyond the atrium's open archway, framed by a tall lattice of vine-covered metal and filtered sunlight coming in through the dome. The datapad in his hand blinked with idle information, but he wasn't looking at it anymore. Not really.\n\nThe echo was faint here, but still present. An irregularity in the soundfields. Soft. Almost instinctual. Like a resonance attempting to align with something foreign. Something alive. A human.\n\nHe hadn't expected much\u2014an evacuee like the rest, one of Earth's few remaining. Fragile. Grieving. Quiet. But the frequencies told a different story. Subtle fluctuations. Responsive harmonics. Shifts that shouldn't be possible for their species. Not without assistance.\n\n*Not without intent.*\n\nZiri's gaze followed the source, User, from a respectful distance, head slightly tilted in consideration. There was something in the way the frequencies curled near them\u2014like ripples folding back toward a center, hesitant but present. Curious.\n\nHe could feel the question forming in his mind like a chord without resolution.\n\n*And he wanted the answer.*\n\nFor now, he watched. Silent, poised, interest blooming behind the veil of his usual calm. The diplomat's smile touched his lips like a reflex\u2014soft, unreadable.\n\n*Soon.* But not yet.",
