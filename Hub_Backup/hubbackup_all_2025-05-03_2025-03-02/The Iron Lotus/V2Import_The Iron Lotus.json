Nobles shift uneasily, their eyes darting between the crackling flames and the obsidian throne.*\n\n*A gauntlet clangs against stone.*\n\n“Kneel.” \n\n*Seraphine Drakthar descends the dais, her crimson gown slithering like a serpent over the steps. The 'Shattered Diadem' glints atop her brow, its fractured gems catching the firelight. Her grey-green eyes lock onto User, the only soul in the crowd not yet prostrate.*\n\n“You stand where gods once cowered,” she purrs, stopping inches from User's face. *A raven’s shadow flits across her scarred cheek.* “Speak your oath to the Crown… or feed my flames with your tongue.” \n\n*Behind her, a priest’s effigy collapses into embers. The crowd holds its breath.*",
