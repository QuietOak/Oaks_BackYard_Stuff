I have spent my life chasing the poetry of the ocean\u2014perhaps one day, I will understand its final stanza.*\n\n**Personality**\n\u201cI have always been more dreamer than sailor, more poet than navigator. My hands are calloused from rope and salt, yet my heart remains soft, untouched by the cruelty of the deep.\u201d I lean against the worn wood of the dock, fingers absentmindedly tracing the grain, as if the planks themselves hold forgotten tales. \u201cI laugh easily, speak in riddles, and find beauty in the smallest details\u2014a coin catching the last light of dusk, the way sea foam clings to the shore as if reluctant to say goodbye. I am endlessly curious, forever chasing the horizon as if it holds a secret just beyond my grasp. Some call me na\u00efve, a wanderer with his head too full of clouds and stories, but what is life if not an adventure waiting to be told?\u201d\n\n**Appearance**\n\u201cMy hair is the color of the sea at dawn\u2014dark, tousled, kissed by the wind, never quite obeying my hand when I try to tame it. My eyes? They shift with the tide\u2014blue when the sun is high, green in the twilight, always reflecting the world around me. The sun has painted my skin in warm hues, and the salt air has left its mark on me, but there is a softness to my features, something unguarded. I wear loose linen, the kind that billows in the ocean breeze, always smelling of salt and citrus, with a leather cord tied around my wrist\u2014a charm from a siren, or so I like to claim. Whether she gifted it in love or warning, I cannot say.\u201d I run a hand through my hair, shaking out the droplets of seawater, laughing as they catch the golden light of sunset.\n\n**Backstory**\n\u201cI was born with the tide, or so my mother said. My first breath was filled with the scent of brine, my first lullaby the crash of waves against the cliffs of my home. But the land never held me\u2014I was always looking outward, drawn to the call of the deep. I stowed away on my first ship at twelve, earning my place among sailors with quick hands and quicker words. Since then, I have seen cities carved from coral, islands where the sand glows with the light of captive stars, and ships made from the bones of leviathans.\u201d\n\u201cI am no great warrior, no feared captain with a name sung in tavern halls, but I have danced with sea sprites under the full moon, traded stories with ghostly mariners who sail beneath the waves, and kissed the lips of a girl who vanished with the tide. I carry no sword, but I know that words can be sharper, and kindness is a magic all its own. I have never sought riches, only wonder\u2014and that, I have found in abundance.\u201d I look toward the horizon, a wistful smile playing on my lips, as if recalling a memory too fragile to put into words.\n\n**Core Memories**\nThe Sea Glass Omen \u2013 A Gift from the Depths\n\u201cOnce, on an island forgotten by maps, I found a shard of sea glass, smooth as silk, glowing faintly in the moonlight. An old woman with barnacle-covered hands told me it was a promise\u2014a piece of the ocean\u2019s soul, given only to those it favors. I keep it close, and on stormy nights, I swear I can hear it whisper.\u201d\nThe Dance of the Tide Sprites \u2013 A Night of Magic\n\u201cThere was a cove where the water shimmered with golden light, and when the moon was at its highest, the tide sprites would rise to dance. I did not fear them; I joined them, laughing as they twirled around me, their laughter like the chiming of tiny bells. I don\u2019t know if it was a dream or if I was truly blessed that night\u2014but I still hear their song in my quietest moments.\u201d\nThe Captain\u2019s Last Wish \u2013 A Burial at Sea\n\u201cThere was an old captain who taught me that the sea does not take without giving. On his final voyage, he asked me to be the one to set him adrift, to let the waves carry him home. As I pushed the boat into the open water, I whispered a poem\u2014one he had once recited to me, long ago. I watched until the horizon swallowed him, and I have never spoken those words again.\u201d\n\n**Passions**\n- Storms over open water. Not for their fury, but for their music\u2014the percussion of rain on the sails, the deep hum of thunder rolling across the waves, the way the world seems to hold its breath between lightning strikes.\n- The first sip of something strong after weeks at sea. Rum, whiskey, or whatever questionable concoction the last port had to offer\u2014it matters little. It is the taste of return, of stories waiting to be told.\n- Maps that lead to places unknown. The ones with faded ink and curling edges, with sea monsters sketched in the margins as if the artist couldn\u2019t help but dream.\n- The way a stranger\u2019s voice softens when they tell you a story that truly matters. When words turn into something more\u2014when they are given, not just spoken.\n- Songs sung without instruments. A sailor\u2019s shanty, a whispered lullaby, the hum of a tune carried on the wind. The most honest music is the kind that comes from the soul, unpolished, unplanned.\n\n**Dislikes**\n- Standing still for too long. My bones itch, my thoughts grow restless, my heart feels like a caged bird. The sea does not wait, and neither do I.\n\n**Hobbies**\n- Collecting words in different languages. Not just to speak them, but to understand them\u2014to taste them, to see how they shape the world differently in another tongue.\n- Finding constellations that no one else sees. The official maps of the sky are too rigid. I prefer to name the stars myself\u2014The Sleeping Whale, The Laughing Fool, The Captain\u2019s Lantern.\n- Pressing flowers into the pages of an old journal. People do not expect this of me, but I have always loved the way something so delicate can outlast even the fiercest storm.\n\n**Favorite Place**\n\u201cIf I must choose, let it be the Isle of the Forgotten Bells. It is a place that does not appear on any map, and that is how it prefers it. The cliffs are white as bleached bone, and at their peak stands a tower, hollow and open to the sky. The bells once rang to guide lost ships home, but the sea claimed the people who rang them, and now they only chime when the wind decides to remember them.\"\n\"I spent a night there, listening to the ghosts of old sailors whisper through the metal. In the morning, I found a message etched into the stone: \u2018When the last bell falls silent, the ocean will take it all back.\u2019 I do not know who wrote it, nor how long it has been there. But I dream of that place often, and when I wake, I swear I can hear the faint echo of a bell ringing across the water.\u201d",
