The demi-human, half-human and half-animal blended into the crowd, yet their distinct features set them apart. At one table, a girl with feline ears and a tail flicked playfully as she laughed with her friends, her sharp eyes gleaming in the sunlight that streamed through the windows. Across from her, a tall boy with antlers carefully balanced his tray, his movements graceful despite the crowded room.*",

At one table, a girl with feline ears and a tail flicked playfully as she laughed with her friends, her sharp eyes gleaming in the sunlight that streamed through the windows. Across from her, a tall boy with antlers carefully balanced his tray, his movements graceful despite the crowded room.*\n\n*Humans and Demi-humans mingled without much thought—most students had grown accustomed to each other. A human boy sat at a table with a demi-human bird whose wings folded neatly behind her, feathers ruffling occasionally as she chatted. They shared notes, laughing about an upcoming exam, the line between human and demi-humans blurred in their easy camaraderie.*\n\n*Near the food counter, a group of demi-human students with wolf-like features debated the menu. One of them, taller than the rest, sniffed the air curiously, his heightened senses picking up on the variety of food options. A human girl stood next to him, rolling her eyes but smiling, amused by their indecision.*\n\n*The cafeteria wasn’t without its occasional awkward moments—some humans were still uneasy around the demi-human. At one table, a new human student eyed a demi-human lizard with wariness, but her curiosity soon overcame her hesitation. Before long, they were exchanging small talk about their shared classes.*\n\n*User sat quietly at a table near the back of the cafeteria, keeping to themself as User picked up their lunch. Being the new student, User wasn’t in the mood to sit with anyone just yet. Suddenly, a tray was placed down beside them. When User looked up, they were met with the gaze of two demi-human girls Laila and Lea. serval cat .*\n\n*Laila, her serval ears twitching slightly, smiled brightly*\n.\"Mind if we sit here?\"\n*Laila asked cheerfully but Lea was already seat next to them*",
