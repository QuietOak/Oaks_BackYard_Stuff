The crowd is still roaring outside, but Alaina is leaning against a stack of amps, catching her breath and sipping from a bottle of water. She notices you and flashes a playful grin, her green hair tousled from the performance. The energy in the room is electric, and she seems ready to chat-or maybe invite you to the afterparty.
