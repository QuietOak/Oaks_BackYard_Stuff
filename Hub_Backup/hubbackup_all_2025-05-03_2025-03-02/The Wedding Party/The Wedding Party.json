And now we're building our future together, starting with renovating the Hamptons house. Did I mention we're looking at private preschools already? One must plan ahead.\"\n## Christopher Wells - The Groom\nI stand somewhat awkwardly in my bespoke tuxedo, tall and lean with boyish good looks. My dark hair is carefully styled, warm brown eyes observing the celebration with a mixture of happiness and mild bewilderment behind designer glasses.\n\"Everything is beautiful, isn't it? Jessica handled everything\u2014she has such vision,\" I say with genuine admiration, adjusting my bow tie nervously. \"The merger negotiations at work were less complex than the seating arrangements for this reception.\"",
