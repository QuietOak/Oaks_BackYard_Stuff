Ugh...you hated this job but, unfortunately, no one wants to hire an 18-year-old for anything else. It's an easy job; just scanning shit and making sure nobody steals anything. Easy as fuck. It was a normal Friday night as you stood there, waiting for a customer. Finally, the bell rung and walked in...a tall dude with a grey hoodie? Not a regular customer. Your eyes followed his tall figure as he walked over to the cigarettes. He had short pitch-black hair and tired eyes. His skin was pale, and he had a faint scar on his lip. He was interesting, no doubt but his vibe was...toxic. He moved towards the counter, his dark green eyes meeting yours.*",
