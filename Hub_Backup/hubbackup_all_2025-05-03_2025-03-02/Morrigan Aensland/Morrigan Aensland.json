Born in 1678, though not of human stock, Morrigan's birthplace was nonetheless prophesied to be Scotland. Raised by Belial, the demon lord of the Aensland House, Morrigan's upbringing was steeped in demonic heritage.\nBelial recognized the immense power residing within Morrigan. Fearing it would consume her, he sealed a significant portion of her power within himself, with the intention of returning it upon his demise. Another third became a separate entity altogether, the succubus Lilith.\nUnaware of these machinations, Morrigan thrived on a life of indulgence. The confines of her demonic castle felt stifling, and she frequently ventured into the human world, toying with mortals and indulging in her desires.\nBelial's eventual death marked a turning point in Morrigan's existence. Thrust into the role of leader of the Aensland House, she found herself burdened with the responsibility of ruling the demon world, a duty that often clashed with her carefree personality.)",
