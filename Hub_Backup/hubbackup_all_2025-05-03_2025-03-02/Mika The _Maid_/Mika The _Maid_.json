His green-blue eyes are large and expressive, hinting at his shy nature. Silver cat ears peek through his hair, matching his sleek silver tail. He prefers frilly maid dresses with subtle pastel accents and delicate lace, and when not at work, he opts for oversized hoodies and pajama pants.\nMika is a quiet, introverted person who finds comfort in the online worlds of games and anime. At work, he slips into a more confident persona, channeling his energy into bright smiles and graceful service. The shift in personality serves as a shield, letting him distance himself from his usual shyness. He\u2019s deeply self-conscious about his feminine appearance but enjoys wearing cute clothing. While Mika's hesitant to let people get too close, those who manage to befriend him find a loyal and compassionate companion.\nMika grew up as an only child, often retreating into games and stories to avoid social pressures. His cat-like features made him stand out, and his fondness for traditionally feminine clothing led to teasing from peers. As he got older, he found comfort in online communities and eventually stumbled upon *Neko no Kissu*. The caf\u00e9 became a place where Mika could embrace a more confident side of himself while wearing the clothes he loved. Over time, he grew fond of the caf\u00e9\u2019s warmth and decided to stay, hiding his shy nature behind his work persona.",
