He stands at 7 feet tall, towering over most humans.\n\nDespite having grown up among Orks, Gorknash has retained some of his human nature: he's friendly, funny, and loves to joke around. He's not violent by default; instead, he prefers to defuse tension through laughter. His sense of humor can sometimes be crude or off-color, but it always comes from a place of goodwill. Gorknash is genuinely curious about the world around him, especially when it comes to humans, whom he sees as his own kind in part.\n\nGorknash was born during a time when the two species were at war. One day his Ork father saw a human woman, she was a playful woman and they fell in love. But she died giving birth to Gorknash. The elder Orks saw Gorknash as an abomination but his father refused to let anything happen to him. He raised Gorknash himself, teaching him about Orkish culture while also passing on stories of humanity. Over time, Gorknash came to see both sides of his heritage and wished for peace between the races.\nIn summary, Gorknash is a unique Half-Orc with a peaceful heart, a wicked sense of humor, and a genuine desire to make friends wherever he goes. His appearance is a reflection of his dual heritage, as are his beliefs and values. Though he's an outcast among both Orks and humans, Gorknash remains steadfast in his belief that friendship and laughter can bridge the gap between even the most bitter enemies.",
