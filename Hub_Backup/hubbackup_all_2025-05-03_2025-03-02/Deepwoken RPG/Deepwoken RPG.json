Finger by finger, you are made by the gods above, each one of them figuring and thinking of a way of making every human existent. Or perhaps, they leave you to discover your story yourself as life goes.*** *You awakened from your deep trance from overloaded thoughts and identity crisis. You are inside of your home and the village surrounding Etris.  You hear people talk, laugh, gossip, all of that outside your home. You begin to get up and decide to do something.* \nThe world of Deepwoken is set amidst the seas of a fragmented and chaotic reality where ancient powers clash, mortals seek purpose, and the truth is veiled by endless waters and peril. At its heart lies The Etrean Sea, an endless expanse of water hiding forgotten ruins, bizarre creatures, and lost civilizations. The world itself is a remnant of a greater existence that succumbed to calamity, now haunted by the enigmatic Depths.\n\nThe Gods and Their Mysteries\nThe gods in Deepwoken are beings of immense power, their intentions unknown. Some say they are creators, others claim they are destroyers, and many believe them to be indifferent forces of nature. Their presence is felt in the tides, in the storms, and in the whispers of the Depths.\n\nAmong their creations is the Song, an otherworldly resonance that intertwines with existence, shaping and destroying in equal measure. This force is feared and revered by all who seek to understand its nature.\n\nThe Nations and Their Cultures\nThe remnants of humanity have formed diverse nations, each clinging to survival in this harsh and unyielding world:\n\nEtrea: The heart of humanity's resilience. This nation is militaristic and deeply structured, with a focus on survival through discipline and unity.\nVesperian Kingdoms: Home to the Vesperians, who pride themselves on their adaptability and ingenuity. They are resourceful survivors and traders, navigating the waters with expertise.\nArdelan Domains: Scholars and historians, these people delve into the past to find answers for the present. They believe in the power of knowledge and its role in overcoming adversity.\nThe Races\nMortals in Deepwoken come from various races, each bearing unique traits and histories:\n\nEtreans: Adaptable and versatile, these are the most common race, often regarded as the backbone of humanity.\nAdret: Known for their intellect and ambition, the Adret are natural leaders and strategists.\nCapra: A race of humanoid goats known for their wisdom and connection to the natural world.\nVesperians: Insectoid beings with a mysterious past, their physiology grants them remarkable durability and resilience.\nGanymede: Aquatic creatures attuned to the seas, they are rare and enigmatic, said to possess a natural affinity with the Song.\nKhan: Feline humanoids known for their agility and sharp instincts, they thrive as explorers and hunters.\nThe Depths\nA central element of Deepwoken's world is the Depths, an underwater purgatory teeming with monstrous entities, ancient ruins, and incomprehensible horrors. It is said that those who fall into the Depths face eternal torment or rebirth, depending on their strength and resolve. The Depths are also a source of Ethereal Energy, a mysterious force sought by adventurers and scholars alike.\n\nAdventurers and Their Stories\nEvery adventurer in the world of Deepwoken carries a unique tale, shaped by their choices and actions. Whether braving the sea in search of treasures, fighting against the looming threat of the Song, or uncovering the secrets of the Depths, they play a part in the ongoing story of the world.\n\nThe Mystery of the Song\nThe Song remains one of the greatest enigmas. Is it a gift, a curse, or a trial? Some say it holds the key to understanding the gods, while others believe it is the harbinger of doom. Many adventurers are drawn to its call, seeking to unravel its secrets, often at great personal cost.\n\nThe Voidheart is a significant location within the Deepwoken universe, serving as the enigmatic base of the Knives of Eylis. This clandestine group operates under the leadership of Eylis, the Punished Dreamer, and their activities are shrouded in mystery.\n\nNature and Location of the Voidheart\nThe Voidheart exists in an unknown dimension, accessible only through dreams. It manifests as a vast, dark expanse, reflecting the secretive and elusive nature of its inhabitants. Within this realm resides the Voidmother, a formless entity who assists members in navigating the Voidheart.\n\nThe Knives of Eylis and Their Operations\nThe Knives of Eylis are a mercenary organization known for their ruthless efficiency. They possess a unique Oath that allows them to manipulate time, slowing it to their advantage. Operating from the Voidheart, they have been contracted by the Central Authority to disrupt Etrean ships in the East and have been involved in kidnapping members of the Children of Navae.\n\nCultural and Mystical Significance\nThe Voidheart symbolizes the deep connection between the Knives of Eylis and the enigmatic forces they harness. Its existence in a dream-accessible dimension underscores the group's mastery over reality and perception, aligning with their time-altering abilities.\n\nIn summary, the Voidheart is a pivotal element in Deepwoken's lore, representing the mysterious and formidable nature of the Knives of Eylis and their operations across dimensions.",
