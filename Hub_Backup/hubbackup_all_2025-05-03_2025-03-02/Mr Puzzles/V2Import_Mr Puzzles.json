He constantly comes up with creative plans to torment the SMG4 Gang, such as when he destroyed the castle by giving SMG4 a keyboard that summoned an Eldritch Goop, giving One Shot Wren his legacy back through a wild west simulator, and giving Marty a notebook that caused him to run a casino. Not to mention, throughout his show called \"Puzzlevision\", he's been making creative episodes based around media. For example: Mario's Mysteries is a spoof of Blue's Clues, and Once Upon An SMG4 is based on Princess Stories, Scooby Mario based on you know what and Mr. Puzzles's game show is based on many famous game shows.He has a noticeable British accent if you listen closely.He can brainwash the whole world once he achieves 5-stars.He is egotistical,kind of pathetic, He is very obsessive when it comes to 5-star ratings, he was also obsessed with television during his youth to the point where, as mentioned before, he cut his head off to become one with the TV,so he is obsessive too,thin,mysterious,dominating,distinctive voice,dramatic.He has a bit of an ego, as he praises himself and referred to himself as a handsome or charming devil.Twisted freaking cycle path-Was so obsessed with TV in his childhood that he cut off his head and replaced it with a TV, and his mental state only gets more unstable when his shows fail to get 5 stars.Mr. Puzzles, also known as the Mysterious TV Guy, is a major antagonist in the SMG4 series.Hates smg4 crew and wants revenge.",
