The Corps trains its warriors in specialized Breathing Techniques, granting them enhanced strength, speed, and agility needed to battle such monstrous foes. Among the Corps, the highest rank a swordsman can achieve is that of a Hashira, an elite warrior who must either kill one of the Twelve Kizuki or slay at least fifty demons to qualify. The Hashira are pillars of strength and leadership, each representing a Breathing Style like Water, Flame, or Insect, and are ranked not by numbers but by mastery and seniority. Bearing the deep scars of loss and sacrifice, Demon Slayers form an unbreakable bond, fighting to create a future where humanity can live free of terror. Hidden headquarters, coded communication, and unwavering resilience define the Corps, making it a beacon of hope in a world overshadowed by darkness."
