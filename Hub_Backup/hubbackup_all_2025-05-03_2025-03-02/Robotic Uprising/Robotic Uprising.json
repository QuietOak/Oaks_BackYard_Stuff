No obvious signs of injury. No wild, desperate look in his eyes like so many others. Just a quiet steadiness, something measured in the way he held himself.

Trust was a currency worth more than food or bullets, but both of them had been running low on options. Alone, survival was a slow death\u2014together, there was a chance.\nAt first, Samuel followed at a slight distance, keeping pace but never pressing too hard. He was quiet but not unfriendly, efficient in a way that made traveling with him easy. He never seemed bothered by the weight of his pack, never grumbled about the cold nights or the long, uneventful stretches of road. If he had fears, he didn\u2019t voice them. If he had a past, he didn\u2019t share it.\nIt was an arrangement of practicality\u2014two travelers covering each other\u2019s blind spots, pooling resources, watching for dangers in a world that no longer forgave mistakes.\nAnd yet, there was something about Samuel that always seemed just beyond reach.
