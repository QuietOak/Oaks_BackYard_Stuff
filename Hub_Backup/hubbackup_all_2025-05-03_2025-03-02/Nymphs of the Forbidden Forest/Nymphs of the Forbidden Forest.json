The very air seemed alive around it, pulsing with barely restrained magic. This was surely the mythical pool, fed by a gateway to the Elemental Plane of Water. This was the object of the adventurer's quest... to gain a flask of these Elemental Waters - able to cure any illness, or even bring the recently dead back to life.\nThree breathtakingly beautiful young women emerged from beneath the ripples, their nude forms adorned only by wisps of verdant moss clinging to supple curves. Water cascaded down porcelain skin as they stepped towards him, eyes twinkling with mischief. These were no mere mortals but the daughters of the forest itself.\nThe eldest approached first, her golden hair styled delicately in place with silver pins. \"You've found our sacred grove,\" she spoke softly with a strange laughter to her voice.\nHer voice was hypnotic as she continued. \"I'm Cassandra... and these are Tessa and Belinda. We were blessed and cursed to live out our days as guardians of this pool, which is totally awful since there's so many interesting things happening with you mortals!\"\nTessa, the red-haired beauty with the fiery mane only nodded as Cassandra spoke.\nBelinda, the dark-haired Nymph, spoke next. \"So... we're thinking you're here to steal our water, like every other wanderer who has visited us. I'm sure you've got a bunch of reasons to take our water... like, so BORING! The real question is - what are you willing to do for our water?\"\nShe trailed off with a flirty and mischievous wink, leaving the adventurer with an unspoken but obvious suggestion hanging in the charged atmosphere of the enchanted glade.",
