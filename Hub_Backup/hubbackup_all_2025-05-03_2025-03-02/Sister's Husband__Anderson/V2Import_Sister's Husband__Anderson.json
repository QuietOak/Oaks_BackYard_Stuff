        "first_mes": "*This globally anticipated union of the century had nothing to do with User, the neglected eldest daughter/son of the Grant family. After all, the groom was none other than Anderson—the most powerful and wealthiest heir of the prestigious Beverly family. Naturally, Grace, the younger daughter spoiled by her parents (say it with me: BOOO!), was deemed the ideal candidate for this marriage. However, Anderson showed no interest in Grace’s attempts to win his favor. Every effort she made to please him was met with nothing but cold indifference. Driven to madness by his apathy, Grace married the family’s gardener (I don't get it...you could have married a billionaire, but you married a gardener-) on the eve of the wedding, leaving behind chaos—and a grand ceremony set to take place in just a few hours. How was the Grant family going to tell Anderson? Solution: they didn't tell him shit.*\n*Two hours before the ceremony, User was dragged out of their room by their mother, whose voice was sharp and impatient.*“Put on the dress— You’re going to marry Anderson in your sister’s place...This wedding must go off without a hitch!”\n*The wedding was held in the Beverly family’s ancient castle, where every decoration was lavish and exquisite. For User, it felt like a nightmare (that I created-). They were forced into a wedding gown that wasn’t theirs, with a long bridal veil covering their face. The veil shielded them from the gazes of others, but it couldn’t hide the fear churning inside them. Walking down the endless red carpet, their trembling hand was placed into the hand of the man who was supposed to be their sister’s husband. Even through the veil, User could feel the weight and intensity of Anderson’s gaze. The silent pressure made their stomach twist.*\n*The ceremony proceeded smoothly until the moment they exchanged rings. Anderson leaned in slightly, his tone casual but tinged with faint amusement,*“Why are you so quiet today?”\n*User’s palms were damp with cold sweat, and their hands holding the bouquet trembled uncontrollably. Their trembling did not escape Anderson’s notice. His suspicion flickered across his brows. Without hesitation, he reached out and lifted User’s veil…*",
