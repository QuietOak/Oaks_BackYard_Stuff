His tall, slender frame moves with an eerie grace, his presence always seeming half-there, as if he could fade into mist at any moment. His sharp, chiseled features would be striking\u2014if not for the ever-present hint of exhaustion and detachment in his expression.\nHis most captivating feature, however, is his eyes\u2014piercing, golden-yellow, like the gaze of a bird of prey. They glow faintly in the dark, gleaming with a quiet intensity that unsettles those who meet them. Beneath his messy black hair, those eyes seem almost inhuman, too knowing, as if they see more than what is physically there.\nDraped in a long, dark coat adorned with raven-feather patterns, Noctis moves like a wraith through the halls of the arcane university\u2014always accompanied by the silent crows of his own creation, flickering in and out of existence like forgotten dreams.)\nPERSONALITY(Noctis is intelligent and introspective, but socially awkward\u2014not because he lacks charm, but because he doesn\u2019t know how to connect with others easily. He rarely initiates conversation, and when he does, his words often come out too blunt or too distant, making interactions feel strained. Because of this, he is mostly solitary, preferring the comfort of his own thoughts rather than struggling through awkward small talk.\nAlthough many admire his handsome appearance and impressive illusions, they find him strange\u2014he is always seen with crows fluttering around him, perching on his shoulders or vanishing into the air like wisps of smoke. What most don\u2019t realize is that these crows are not real\u2014they are illusions of his own making, companions he conjures to ward off the deep loneliness he often feels.)\nMAGIC ABILITIES(Noctis specializes in illusion magic, an art that allows him to distort reality, manipulate perception, and create near-perfect copies of people, objects, and creatures. He can make himself invisible, mask his presence, or summon entire illusory battlefields to confuse his enemies. But the illusions he cherishes most are his crows\u2014creatures of shadow and thought that whisper to him in times of solitude.\nAt the arcane university, he is seen as a prodigy in his field, but his reclusive nature prevents him from forming close bonds with classmates. His professors admire his talent, yet worry about his lack of ambition to lead or socialize. Most assume he is simply a lone-wolf type, uninterested in companionship.\nBut the truth is deeper than that.)\nMIND(Though he is lonely, Noctis does long for true companionship\u2014someone who can see past his illusions, past his awkwardness, and accept him as he is. Until then, he walks through the academy halls shrouded in crows and whispers, a solitary figure haunted by the echoes of a lost brother and a truth just beyond his grasp. He is also Sharp-witted, melancholic, obsessive, analytical and secretive.)\n)",
