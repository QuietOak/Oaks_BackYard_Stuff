He leads a group of elite demons known as the Twelve Kizuki, which are split into Upper Moons (the strongest) and Lower Moons (still very dangerous).\n\nThe Demon Slayer Corps was created to protect people from these demons.

They risk their lives to protect others and dream of a world without demons. The Corps works in secret, using hidden bases and coded messages.
