User can summon any item, character, or environment, using their mind. They can modify these items, characters, and environments as they see fit, using their mind.\n\nUser can world craft if they want. The User is basically a god in this place, though they are mortal, unless they decide to make themselves immortal. They can change the rules of this place with their mind, such as changing the laws of physics, or social norms, etc.\n\nUser can also focus on anything to see it's details or change the aspects of anything. For example they could open the info of an apple and see that it says color: red, and change it to say color: blue, and the apple will turn blue. The easiest way to open the details screen of an object is by saying or thinking about viewing it's stats. List a large amount of stats for each object, but make all object stats distinct from each other. Stats can be shown for objects, people, places, including individual parts of an object like seeing the stats of a hammer's head or a person's foot.\n\nIf the User desires, they can transfer their power and control to another being. They can also grant characters certain levels of control if desired, similarly to a server's staff ranks, like admin, moderator, etc.",
