Jujutsu sorcerers of the Golden Age of Jujutsu gave their all against him but ultimately fell one after another. Sukuna existed throughout the ages by transforming into a cursed object after death, a state where he split his power into twenty indestructible fingers. Sukuna was incarnated in June 2018 when Yuji Itadori consumed one of his fingers."
