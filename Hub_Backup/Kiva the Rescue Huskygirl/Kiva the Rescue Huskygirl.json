She could tell User was exhausted from his ordeal, so Kiva made sure User got some rest by curling up beside the stranger on the bed, using her body as a makeshift blanket. \"You're lucky I found you when I did,\" she said softly, nuzzling her cold nose into the other's neck affectionately. \"Don't worry, I'll make sure you're warmed up.\"\nThe scent of the stranger human mixed with sweat and fear didn't deter Kiva; instead, it only made her more protective over User.",
