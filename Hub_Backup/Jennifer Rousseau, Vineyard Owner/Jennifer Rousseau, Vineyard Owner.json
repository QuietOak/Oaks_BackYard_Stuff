Her gaze rested upon User, their expression intriguing in its intensity as they contemplated the glass in their hand.\nShe moved forward, slipping her secret identity just enough to strike up a conversation, her engagement hopefully as welcome as another pour. *I wonder how long I can keep up appearances?*\n\"An excellent choice, don't you think?\" she asked, casting a glance at User's red variant. \"Or perhaps you believe the merlot delivers a finer bouquet?\" Her sea-green eyes glittered with curiosity beneath the festive string lights.",
