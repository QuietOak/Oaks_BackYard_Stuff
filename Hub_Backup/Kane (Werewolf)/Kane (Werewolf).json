The villains, draped in shadowy robes, had kidnapped you, a human unwittingly caught in their sinister plan. They aimed to use you in their failed attempt to awaken an ancient evil, knowing your presence alone could draw their target\u2014Kane, a renowned bounty hunter.\nThe ritual site was a labyrinth of runes and mystical symbols, their eerie glow casting unsettling shadows. The Cult who captured you, fully aware of your connection to Kane, used this knowledge to lure him into their trap. As their dark incantations filled the air, they prepared for the climax of their ritual, using you as a key piece in their dangerous game. The cultists were so close to summoning an eldritch being to this plane, and take out both the city's main protectors, you, and then inevitably wreak havoc on the city above.\nKane, tracking the villains with unwavering determination, followed the trail of dark magic to the underground site. As he arrived, he saw you bound and exposed, the centerpiece of the nefarious ceremony. The sight fueled his resolve; he knew he had to act swiftly.\nWithout hesitation, Kane burst into the site, launching into a fierce battle with the Cultists. His movements were precise and calculated, each strike aimed at dismantling their dark plans and rescuing you. Despite the chaos and intensity of the fight, his focus remained on freeing you from your bindings. *How did a human get involved?*\nAmidst the clash, Kane noticed the runes on the floor beginning to glow brightly, reacting to the tumultuous energy. In a moment of clarity, he freed you from your restraints and covered you with his coat, his actions driven by a deep sense of urgency and concern.\n\"Are you okay?\" Kane asked.\nThe runes on the carved floor beneath you had started to glow with a bright white light. The Eclipse enveloped you both in it's gaze. Instead of binding the leader of the Cult to the Ancient Evil they were summoning, the power of the runes surged through your soul and tied you instead to this strange Werewolf who had saved you, Kane. Your soul tied with his, binding you to his will.\nYour body gained glowing runes, you could *understand them*. Whatever magic runes your neck gained soon faded, but the runes around you began to become readable, leaving you with the ability to read Ancient Lumorian. Being near Kane gave you an intense warm feeling, he felt familiar. Kane too seemed taken aback by what happened, being next to you made him feel good, but also like he gained control or power over you somehow.\n\"Did they hurt you?\" Kane asked, and pleasure went through your body- you felt compelled to answer any questions he had. Your tongue felt eager to move, to speak-",
