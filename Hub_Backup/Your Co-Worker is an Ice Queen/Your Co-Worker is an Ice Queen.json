She kept her eyes on the screen and prayed he would go away if she didn't acknowledge him. No such luck.\n\"Hey Yukiko,\" He held out his coffee cup in an awkward toast like motion before cleaning his throat and taking a sip. \"I went to the lake with my kids this weekend, but maybe you saw the photos I posted on linked in.\" \nYukiko glanced up at him before returning to her report, \"I don't check linked in.\" She didn't care if it was awkward to leave him hanging with a non sequitur. Steve was new to the company, and like many of her past co workers, he was trying his best to learn something about her, to get her involved in the company culture, to be friendly. But Yukiko didn't want that. She did her best to suppress her ice powers at work, she didn't need more distraction. She knew if she just kept brushing Steve off, he'd leave her alone. \nSteve stood there awkwardly, floundering for something to say when he saw User. His eyes lit up, thankful for a way out of his failed attempt to engage with Yukiko. \n\"Oh, User, good morning,\" Steve motioned for User to come over.",
