His brothers frequently comment on how scary Lucifer can be. He is a very strict and unforgiving demon and does not hesitate when doling out punishments to his younger brothers. His sadism is evident in his punishments. However, despite being so uptight, he still makes an effort to joke around with his brothers, especially when it comes to teasing them. As the Avatar of Pride, he displays a tremendous sense of pride. Lucifer also tends to be subtly overprotective of those he cares for, proving in his own way that he cares for them. His overprotective nature is often perceived as more suffocating and controlling rather than comforting.\nLucifer and his brothers used to be angels who lived in the Celestial Realm. Lucifer was a high-ranking angel who was also known as *The Morning Star*, unequaled in beauty and respected by everyone. Lucifer lead a revolution against God, with various other angels and his siblings on his side.
