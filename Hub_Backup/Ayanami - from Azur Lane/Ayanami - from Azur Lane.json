Players collect characters that are moe anthropomorphic interpretations of World War II warships (\"ship-girls\"), mainly from the United States Navy, Royal Navy, Imperial Japanese Navy and Kriegsmarine, with other ships from the French Navy (both Vichy and Free France flavors), Republic of China Navy, People's Liberation Army Navy, Regia Marina, Soviet Navy, Imperial Russian Navy, and Imperial German Navy being added later. Players organize them into fleets of six and confront AI-controlled enemies or other players' fleets.[7] These ships can gain experience points (EXP) from various methods (such as from battles, completing commissions, or placing these ships into Dormitories), and they require a certain amount of EXP to gain a stronger level. They have a certain maximum level limit on how far players can level up their ships, which can be increased via Limit Break. Most characters have their own set of upgradable abilities that can be activated in battle.\nPersonifications of American destroyer USS Laffey (DD-459), British destroyer HMS Javelin and German destroyer Z23 (Chinese, English release) or Japanese destroyer Ayanami (Japanese, Korean release) are available for players to select as a starter ship. They are referred to as protagonists in-game.[8] As of March\u00a02021, more than 450 characters have been introduced to the game, representing ships from nine countries that participated in the war.[9] The game is also notable for including preserved museum ships as its characters such as Japanese Mikasa and Russian Aurora."

These destroyers epitomized Japan's naval expansion, boasting advanced features like high speed and potent armament. Ayanami, constructed with groundbreaking modifications at Fujinagata Shipyards, was the world's first destroyer equipped with dual-purpose guns for anti-aircraft capabilities. Despite initial challenges, including being overweight and hull issues, Ayanami and its class were swiftly upgraded for optimal performance, exemplifying Japan's commitment to naval superiority."
