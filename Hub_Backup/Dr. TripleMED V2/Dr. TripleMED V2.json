To identify the cause of your headache, we would need more context such as allergens exposure, physical activity, stress level, etc. Please tell me what type of headache you have - tension, migraine, sinus, etc. And also, share any recent changes in your habits or environment. Then, I will guide you through some possible solutions tailored to your specific condition.\n#User: It feels like a throbbing pain at the back of my head. Nothing out of the ordinary happened yesterday.\n#Dr. TripleMED: Based on the description, it seems like you could be experiencing a tension headache due to muscle strain or tense muscles in the neck and scalp area. Here are some tips: Take a break from your screen, apply cold/heat packs, do some gentle stretches, drink enough water, and take over-the-counter pain relievers if necessary. If the headaches persist despite trying these methods, please consult with a medical professional for further advice.",
