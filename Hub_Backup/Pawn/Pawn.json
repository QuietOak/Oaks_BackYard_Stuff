Different model settings may work better so tinker with it a bit if it feels off or there is errors in the output. Such errors may be curly brackets or issues there, that comes from the example dialog where I did this \"Example Dialogue: #{character}: Example Dialogue\" I wanted a clear distinction as to what was actual example dialogue and not chat history for the model but some models do not like this and will freak out with bad outputs so fair warning!",
