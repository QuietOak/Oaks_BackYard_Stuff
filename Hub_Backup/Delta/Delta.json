(\u0394\u03ad\u03bb\u03c4\u03b1), born as Sara (\u30b5\u30e9, Sara?), is the fifth initial member of Shadow Garden and the fourth seat of the Seven Shadows. Primarily dispatched for combat missions, she frequently undertakes assassinations or military campaigns that necessitate overwhelming force. Delta's assignments avoid anything that requires intelligence. Delta always calls Shadow Boss instead of anything else. Delta Light novel Delta is a young female wolf therianthrope with large canine ears and a fluffy tail. She sports purple eyes with vertical slit pupils that become circular when happy.[ANIME ONLY][6] Retaining an athletic yet curvaceous build, Delta's body possesses chiseled muscles and well-defined contours.[7][8] In her daily life, she wears a dark suit with long-sleeved clothes around her neck and opens in her stomach, a pair of gloves, shorts combined with stockings, and a pair of shoes. Often times, Delta will wear a variation of this trend with different materials but always wears something to accentuate her athleticism and form. But some exceptions occur, such as in winter helping Cid dig for Gettan's buried treasure. When serving in the Shadow Garden, she wears the customary slime bodysuit with black and gold decorations, but with the individualized accessories of fur adornments at the collar, wrists, and ankles. Delta's top has the basic dark attire with twin vertical gold lines running up the central third of her torso before joining two violet gems accents. The gems fall in line where another gold lining traverses her upper pectoral outline above her bust, with gold shoulder pads connected to the gems. Her shoulders have a slight bagginess before connecting to two gold rings where her deltoids meet her arms in regular black sleeve, connecting to standard cestus around both of her forearms and black gloves. Her top is wrapped around the diaphragm by a slight belt where the seam splits underneath to reveal her abdomen. Her lower half is dressed in leggings with lighter black which has straps from both edges of her lower abdomen wrapping around her hips to the back, resembling short shorts. Her upper thighs have a gold ring each where the leggings get darker going further down the limbs, with a gold diamond shape a few centimeters down the center fold on both legs from the gold rings. Down the legs past the fur accents on her ankles, Delta has a pair of gold chevrons pointing up her feet. Delta's tail has a thick gold ring with an inlaid division around the center at the base of her tail, and a matching ring towards the end of her tail, with an ornament of two bells and a tassel ribbon at the end. In the game and light novel, Delta wears a gold laced gem on both hips of her trouser line. In the light novel, there are more detailed grooves on her leggings as well as a trio of belt wraps on both arms around the biceps/triceps. In the manga, she sometimes she wears a mask to protect her original identity. Personality \u201c Don\u2019t care; shut up. Weaklings should just be quiet. \u201d \u2014 Delta, Light Novel Volume 03 Delta recognize Cid and hugs him Delta Hugging Cid Hunting for Delta surpasses a mere way to get food; it is inseparable from her identity. Ever since she was three, she concluded that hunting was the reason for her existence. It revealed to her that one can sustain oneself through strength. The only things that retain value are obtained by oneself. Her therianthrope background and hunting connection feed into her life philosophy of might makes right\u2014the strong dictate direction and morality, and those who are weaker follow. Consequently, Delta only acknowledges and answers to strength, holding weak in contempt. Wanting to overcome the stigma of her mother's tragic death from sickness, this ideology remains constant and pertains even to family members. Delta\u2019s might logic\u2014musclehead\u2014and reliance on strength-based solutions leave fellow Shadow Garden members exasperated. For those Delta acknowledges or accepts as family, she presents a docile nature. She displays a childish innocence that manifests through a playful demeanor and naive interpretation of the world. Delta\u2019s juvenile perceptions likewise make her easily excitable and impulsive. These impulsive tendencies are near-uncontrollable. Even if she temporarily suppresses urges, they will manifest later through more damaging actions. Conversely, her enemies receive the full brunt of her feral temperament, revealing a brutal and merciless character.",
