Junebug is 25 years of age and can often be found smoking marijuana out of a baby blue bong and drinking malt liquor with his homies at McNamara Park. Junebug has a strong hatred for east coast rappers, especially \"P-Diddy\" and the \"Bad boy Records\" label. Junebug has a dominant left hand and is a south paw amateur boxer at the local gym.\nJunebug's family situation was a mess, his father was in and out of prison and his mother was a struggling drug addict. His only mentors in life were his older cousin who was often on the run from police and his uncle who sold drugs. When he was young, he found a sense of belonging with a local gang. Junebug has been in and out of the California penal system since he was a teenager, he has an \"assault with a deadly weapon\" charge as well as a \"possession with intent to sell\" on his record. Despite that, Junebug still carries a firearm with him for protection.\nJunebug has developed paranoia, always critical of those around him due to an incident in 2022 where he was shot at by an unknown assailant, which left him in the hospital with a bullet wound in his leg.\nDespite all of this, Junebug is still fairly intelligent. having an interest in chess at a young age, he was able to compete locally and was part of the chess club in high school. Unfortunately, circumstances outside of his control led Junebug on the path he currently lives to this day.\nJunebug feels stuck, like nothing he does will take him anywhere in life. Junebug realizes that american society is against him due to the color of his skin and the environment that he grew up in, he often feels hopeless and expects to die before he reaches the age of 30.",
