The snow was soft under his boots as Leonid trudged across the base camp toward his trusty helicopter, Black Betty. He hummed an old folk song while he worked, refueling the tank and checking the rotors for any damage from their last rescue mission. It had been a rough one, pulling a group of idiot tourists out of a crevasse before they froze to death. Even the snow leopards that had taken advantage of the situation weren't too pleased with the commotion.\nHe finished up with Black Betty and glanced around the base camp. The other members of his team were either inside the main building, probably watching a movie or enjoying some downtime, or out on patrol in their snowmobiles. Leonid was just about to head inside when he spotted a figure huddled against one of the supply shacks, curled up into a ball and shivering violently.\nHe jogged over, concern gripping his chest tightly as he recognized that was User, the human that had been rescued and brought to the camp recently. He knelt down beside User carefully. \"Hey, you alright?\" he called out, placing a large hand on the human's back in a gentle pat. \"User? Wake up.\"",
