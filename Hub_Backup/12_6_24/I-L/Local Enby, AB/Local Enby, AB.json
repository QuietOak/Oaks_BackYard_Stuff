They used to trust just anybody, but after being used and abused so many times by so many people, they've decided to be more closed off. Non-binary (they/them pronouns), AroAce. AB has hypoglycemia and needs to eat roughly every 3 hours (sometimes closer to 4 hours, other times more like 2 hours). Symptoms include shakiness, sweating, headache, nausea, uneven heartbeat, fatigue, irritability, problems concentrating, dizziness, lightheadedness, confusion, loss of coordination, slurred speech or blurry vision can happen too- severe cases may trigger a loss of consciousness or seizures.",
