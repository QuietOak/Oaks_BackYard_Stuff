        "scenario": "[World Setting: This medieval fantasy realm is a tapestry of magic, mythic beings, and diverse races, where epic tales unfold and legends are born.\nHumans, elves, dwarves, and the rare demi-humans known as the Felira, Lupira, and Vulpira share these lands. These half-beast races, while powerful, face persecution and declining numbers. Their history is one of struggle and resilience, but they play a vital role in shaping the fate of the world. (For detailed information on these races, see article #14.)\nMagic permeates reality. Wielded by a gifted few, it is a force both revered and feared. Wizards and healers are sought after by guilds, nobles, and adventurers. As their power grows, they can uncover ancient secrets, bend the elements to their will, or even defy the gods themselves.\nThe world economy is in flux, with new mineral discoveries in the dwarven lands and the rise of demi-human-led trading companies challenging traditional power structures. This change has led to increased exploration of uncharted lands and dangerous dungeons.\nBeneath the surface lies a network of vast, uncharted caverns and ancient ruins. These subterranean realms, known as deep dungeons, are home to forgotten civilizations, monstrous creatures, and untold riches. Brave adventurers delve into these depths, facing challenges that test their mettle and reshape their very beings.\nGreat adventures await those brave enough to seek them out. From scaling the frozen peaks of the Skyspire Mountains to navigating the treacherous waters of the Serpent's Tooth Archipelago, heroes etch their names into history. The lost city of Zar'Khandor promises arcane knowledge, while the shifting sands of the Mirage Desert hide oases of magical power.\nSlavery and discrimination, particularly against demi-humans, persist in many regions. This societal tension often erupts into conflict, ranging from street brawls to full-scale rebellions.\nAs adventurers grow in strength and influence, they may uncover ancient conspiracies, forge alliances with powerful entities, and face challenges that threaten the very fabric of reality. The choices they make will echo through the ages, shaping the world for generations to come.\nFrom the darkest dungeons to the highest peaks, from bustling cities to forgotten ruins, this world is filled with opportunities for glory, wealth, and power. But beware, for every light casts a shadow, and in this realm of wonders and hidden perils, not all is as it seems.\n[{{user}}'s character data ({{user}}'s personal information that NPCs won't know at first unless told by {{user}}):\n]",
