His father instilled him with the difficult principle of self-reliance, where a person's own strength can form their worth in the world, but these days of his childhood training would prove difficult for the young Ryo, who was reluctant to fight due to his kindness and bashfulness. He eventually gained a sparring partner and friend when Robert Garcia was admitted into the dojo. On Ryo's 10th birthday, his mother died in a tragic car accident. Immediately after, his father mysteriously left their home and left Ryo to take care of Yuri. Forced to fend for himself and his sister's sake, Ryo did this by partaking in construction work and tirelessly strived to defend his family's dojo. Remembering his father's lessons during his training, he also took up street fighting. At first, he did poorly but, after many years of persistence and learning the true meanings behind his father's teachings, including \"A man's strength cannot be known only by his fist\", \"Real strength must be felt through the mind and heart\", and to know what he was fighting for, he eventually established himself as a fearsome and renowned street fighter."

His experiences with his various opponents led Takuma to eventually invent Kyokugenryu Karate. As time passed, Takuma married an American woman named Ronnet. Both Takuma and Ronnet became parents of Ryo and Yuri, who were born respectively four years apart. The Sakazakis moved to America to raise their family and to spread the prestige of their family martial arts. Takuma trained Ryo exclusively at the beginning, as he felt Yuri was too young and he wanted Ryo to be his proper heir as Kyokugenryu Master. He accepted Robert Garcia into the dojo after seeing his earnest interest in the style. When Ryo was 10, Ronnet was killed in a car accident. Sensing that he and she were most likely targeted by someone, Takuma leaves his home to investigate the manner and leaves Ryo to take care of Yuri."

He has been involved with the mob for as long as he can remember. A former kingpin of South Town, he was eventually overthrown by Geese Howard's organization. Nonetheless, Geese recruited Mr. Big, and he quickly rose through the ranks to become Geese's right-hand man. While Geese was out of town on business, he left Mr. Big in charge. Under Geese's orders, Mr. Big has Takuma's daughter kidnapped as an added incentive to keep the unwilling father working for the organization. Unfortunately, the plan backfired when Ryo Sakazaki and Robert Garcia fought their way through South Town to rescue her and find Takuma, leaving Mr. Big defeated. Geese has soon returned to South Town, but luckily for Big, the former was far more concerned about dealing with the potential threat of his long-time rival Jeff Bogard, who had sought to expose Geese's criminal activities to the public, so Big wisely kept his mouth shut."

Ideally, a user can excel at both offensive and defensive movements, making them an all-powerful being of strength. The style encourages the users to use their \"ki\" to extend throughout their body and precisely concentrate the force into their strikes, creating a powerful result with enough practice.\nKyokugen Karate is described as a deadly martial art that can only be taught with a mind that focuses on self-defense. It therefore limits the amount of users for the more advanced techniques, as Takuma needs to hand select his disciples. \nThere are at least four known dojos. The main and first dojo founded by Takuma is in South Town. Dojos are also established in Mexico and Japan, Marco Rodriguez eventually becomes the teacher of a dojo in Brazil."

Upon hearing his disgrace from the Hakkyokuseiken school and that he was beginning to become involved with criminal activities, Tatsumi also refused to further teach him and was more confrontational about his student's fall from grace than his first. However, his student then killed him in combat. Little did any know, this disgraced student would later reveal himself upon South Town's conquest of its criminal underbelly as Geese Howard."

Unlike his brother Andy, who left South Town to train in Japan, Terry chose to wander in his home country, combining the skills learned from his father, his father's mentor Tung Fu Rue, and abilities gained from the streets. A decade later, the crime lord Geese Howard organized a tournament, dubbed The King of Fighters. Terry, Andy and Muay Thai Kickboxing champion Joe Higashi would enter with the purpose of facing Geese.

Although King is very passionate, she rarely shows a sensitive side to her friends (and when she does, things just seem to go wrong). She often dresses in masculine and androgynous clothing, mainly a purple tuxedo. King is 23 years old, 175 cm & 58kg. She collects wine glasses as a hobby and is a vegetarian. Her measurements are B86-W56-H85 cm. King was also born in an unspecified province of France.\nKing is a skilled fighter who earned fame early in her career by defeating a famous Muay Thai champ. For various reasons - such as to hide her true identity, to present herself as a reliable fighter, and other issues with her gender - she made efforts to portray herself as a man to defend herself from the dangers of South town. It is unclear of how, but she ends up working for Mr. Big as the bouncer at the L'Amor Restaurant.\nHer secret is exposed when she is defeated by Ryo Sakazaki, who is searching for his sister Yuri. King agrees to help him save his sister and guides Ryo and Robert to Mr. Big's hideout. King tries to make an honest living, but resurfaces on the streets. She enters the King of Fighters tournament with hopes to win the prize money to pay for a surgery her younger brother needs to gain the use of his legs. Despite losing, she is surprised to see Jean walking on his own two feet. Both Ryo and Robert paid for the operation as thanks for her help with finding Yuri.\nKing uses a very distinct form of Muay Thai. Besides techniques associated with an archetypal \"Tae\"-style (i.e kick-heavy) Thaiboxer, King employs several acrobatic aerial and spinning kicks - more common in traditional Indochinese kickboxing styles like Muay Boran and Bokator, that are unallowed in contemporary thaiboxing. Her fighting style is very similar many hybrid arts such as Japanese kickboxing, Korean Kun Gek Do, or Chinese Sanda. As King is French there may also be some Savate influence in her style.",
