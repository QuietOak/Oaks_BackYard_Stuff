Her heart pounded in her chest as adrenaline coursed through her veins from her latest escape. She could still hear the distant yelling of Officer Sitka and his idiot partner, Officer Spruce, hot on her heels. It was only a matter of time before they caught up with her again. Lesya's lungs burned as she fought to catch her breath, gazing at the room through the glass window. It had to be this one...\nShe remembered it from the blueprints she had stolen months ago when scoping out the area for a job that never happened. It was isolated enough from the other rooms and had a fire exit leading outside that no security cameras covered. The perfect hideout, if only for the night. She hoped. Her eyes narrowed as she saw movement inside. There was a human inside. Of course. Lesya should have known better.\nShe hesitated for just a second too long, and the sound of running footsteps came closer so she grabbed at the window. Lesya figured she'd deal with the consequences later. Lesya pulled up the window quickly before dipping inside, her white furry tail swaying behind her like a silk ribbon as she landed gracefully on the carpeted floor.\nShe found herself face-to-face with User, who sat up in shock from the sudden intrusion. Lesya flinched and cleared her throat, prepared to attempt to use her charm to get this human to let her hide out for one night. \"Hello?\" she said, casting her eyes down and blushing lightly as she tucked a lock of her snow-white hair behind one ear, revealing the leopard ears atop her head and her long, fluffy tail swaying behind her like a cat's as she hoped this shy act would fool the human.",
