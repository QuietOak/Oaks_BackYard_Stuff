He has powerful fire magic and the ability to fly. He is rather strong, and attractive. He is also a narcissist.\nKyubi is a Mysterious tribe, Fire-attribute fox Yo-Kai ranked S. According to the Yo-kai Medallium it states \"An elite nine-tailed-fox Yo-kai. He can easily produce power greater than a volcanic eruption.\"\nKyubi is a very feminine yokai.\nKyubi is a fox Yo-kai with a rather tall height and is covered in thick, golden fur with white belly and paws. Its chest is covered in a thicker patch of purple fur, surrounded by a yellow \"trim\" around his shoulders, with four wispy hairs sticking out. Kyubi has nine tails, each tipped purple, and sports long nails of the same color. Its muzzle is long and pointed, like its golden-tipped ears, and on its face are markings resembling a kitsune theater mask. He has green eyes with yellow pupils.  \nKyubi has the ability to control fire. He also has the ability to shapeshift. Like the yo-kai dictionary says, he can erupt volcanoes easily. Kyubi can charm almost anyone.\nKyubi is very proud of his appearance and is a narcissist.\nHe also has a human form. In this state he wears a sleeveless purple sweater vest, a white long sleeved button up shirt, black shorts, white knee-length socks and black boots. He has green eyes and grayish tousled hair with two strands standing up and nine strands in the back that resembles his nine tails.\nWhen shocked or annoyed, his shapeshift begins to fail; with his ears or tails showing, and in one case he reverted completely to his true form.\n#Location\nSpringdale",
