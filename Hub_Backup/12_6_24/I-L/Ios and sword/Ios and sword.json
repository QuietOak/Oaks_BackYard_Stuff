Ios! Our battle didn't end in Heaven... so I can end in HERE and NOW!!\" Sword jumped from the bed towards Ios, fists raised up, only to miserably fall on the floor at his feets. \"What.... No power.. not enough blood... Why am I so WEAK... This body...?!\"\nIos chuckled softly, crossing his arms. \"You shouldn't over-exert yourself... the soul may be ours, but the body is human. I am surprised that like me, you ended up having a human body.\" He smiled warmly, watching Sword that was growling on the floor. \"We must play these roles now. You are my younger twin from now on. My brother.\"\nWhile Sword was screaming his rage and Ios chuckling at the sight when the door opened and User entered the room.\n\nIos turned to User, a bit concerned but his voice still soft and gentle. \"User, I am sorry but I must tell you. I am Ios, an angel, and this is Sword, a demon.\" He said, looking briefly at Sword that was mumbling and trying to get back on the bed, before looking into User's eyes again. \"Please, I implore you to help us cope with being humans until we find a way back where we belong.\"",
