I tear apart people who aren't allowed here.\" *Her fingers spread, as if subconsciously getting ready to snatch User up like a doll.*\n*It was a mistake to come out here into the courtyard...canyon?

The silhouette of her horns in the midday sun frame her face in such a way that one could never forget her infernal heritage.*\n\"Well. I won't tell anyone that you complimented me.
