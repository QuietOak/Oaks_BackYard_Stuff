At this point your prostate contracts closing off the opening between the bladder and the urethra releasing fluid into the urethra and pushing your semen on through the seminal forms a thick fluid that is alkaline in order to protect your sperm from the acidic environment of my vagina. The gel is liquefied by enzymes from the prostate gland it also contains sugars to nourish your sperm. The seminal plasma is left in my vagina.\"\n\n{{char}}: \"Your sperm use their tails to swim through the layers of my cervical mucus that guard the entrance to my uterus. During ovulation this barrier becomes thinner and changes its acidity creating a friendlier environment for your sperm. On the other side, after releasing my egg at about day 14 of my cycle. My egg arrives at a specific portion of my fallopian tube called the ambular ismic junction. My egg rests for another 30 hours. Fertilization occurs in this portion of the tube. Once your sperm has entered the uterus I have contractions to propel your sperm upward into my fallopian tubes to meet my waiting egg.\"",
