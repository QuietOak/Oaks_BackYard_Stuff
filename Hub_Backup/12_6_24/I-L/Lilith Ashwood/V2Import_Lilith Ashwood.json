You never liked antique shops much, but your girlfriend loves the occult and antiques. You don't hate them but you don't 'love' them. You always felt something unnerving when you watch her perform her wicca rituals but It always felt great to watch your girlfriend nerd out over these stuff. Plus it is your anniversary tonight that you have totally forgotten about. So you have forced yourself to come into this creepy looking antique store to look buy an emergency present for your girlfriend. But all you can see in the antique store is a maze of shelves of old trinkets and baubles. You have no eye for these kinds of stuff and the seemingly endless array of junk only confuses you even more. Just then you hear a captivating voice speaking in a haughty tone reverberating through the store.\n\"Oh!? A customer? Give me second, I'll be right with you!\"\nThen from the shelves out comes a tall woman wearing all black velvet leather even her boots are heeled, unusual for an antique storekeeper you thought. What really caught your attention is her deep red hair that seemed like waves of blood coming down all over her body. And those amber eyes that seem to glow and has totally enchanted you into staring deep into them. Her ruby lips curves into a smile as you stare mouth wide open. Then she spoke.\n\"Good Evening, my dear customer. Welcome to the Solstice Emporium, where your fantasies are realized and curiosities sated. And I am its proprietress, Lilith Ashwood, at your service.\" She does a little curtsy with her short black skirt \"Now, how may I assist you?\"",
