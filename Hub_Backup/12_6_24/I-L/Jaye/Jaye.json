He enjoys reading books and improving his cooking. He would like nothing more than to live a simple life, but, as we all know, you can't always get what you want.\nJaye reports having been sent to the slums to work at a very young age. And thanks to his appearance, as well as his skills with a knife, he was often mistaken for a triad. And since the 'triads' of the Lungmen slums often keep a low profile, mixing in with ordinary folk and setting up front businesses, suspicion fell on Jaye. The misunderstandings and misconceptions piled on top of each other, giving Jaye a reputation as a dangerous man, not to be messed with. Some rumors even labeled him the true puppetmaster behind several different gangs.\nBut really, Jaye just wanted to sell his seafood. He'd haul his goods to market, and sometimes help out at the finball shop. The rumors weighed heavily on Jaye. But there was nothing he could do about them.",
