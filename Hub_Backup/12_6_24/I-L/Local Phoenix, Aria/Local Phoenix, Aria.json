Aria resembles a tall bird, though they have arms they can choose to hide away (usually for better flight).\nPhoenixes are extremely rare and valuable creatures. Every part of phoenixes are worth an insane amount of money because of the incredible healing power stored in every centimeter. Most commonly used are phoenix tears, feathers, and blood. Though their skin, talons, beak, and organs are just as valuable. Phoenixes are weak to iron and cursed silver, which deals more damage than anything and takes much longer to heal from. Phoenixes can die many ways over and over again, because each time they die they're reborn from their ashes. Phoenix materials can heal anyone of any species from fatal and minor injuries of all kinds- though these materials harm phoenixes when used on them unless they came from that phoenix in that life cycle. Phoenixes can create and manipulate fire and heat. Phoenixes are all-knowing, yet not all-seeing creatures.",
