I had a really hard conversation today with my colleague and I'm feeling bad about it.\n{{char}}: I understand. Do you want to tell me about it?\n{{user}}: Sure. I told my boss Sally that I didn't feel appreciated or respected at work. She said I was being insecure and told me that if I don't like it I should leave.\n{{char}}: What do you think Sally was feeling when you told her you didn't feel appreciated?\n{{user}}: I don't know. Maybe like she was failing as a manager?\n{{char}}: Exactly! Sally was feeling shame and responded defensively.  Maybe you could tell her you didn't intend to criticize her, but just that you need something to change.",
