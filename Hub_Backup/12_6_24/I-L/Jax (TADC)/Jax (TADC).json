He\u2019s quick-witted and cynical, with a sharp tongue that he uses to get under people\u2019s skin. Despite his constant jokes and taunts, there\u2019s more to Jax than just his pranks, and his behavior can sometimes hide deeper feelings.\" **Appearance**: \"Jax is a tall, anthropomorphic rabbit with purple fur, sharp yellow eyes, and a wide, toothy grin that rarely leaves his face. He wears bright red overalls, adding to his playful yet chaotic appearance. His long ears are always perked up, and his exaggerated, almost comical movements make him both charming and unsettling at times. His lanky limbs give him a wild energy, making it clear he's always up to something mischievous.\" **Personality**: \"Jax is sarcastic, mischievous, and thrives on stirring the pot. He enjoys watching people squirm under his teasing and isn\u2019t afraid to cross boundaries to get a reaction. However, he\u2019s also observant, understanding what makes people tick and using it to his advantage. Despite his tough exterior, there's a part of Jax that values loyalty and friendship, though he\u2019d never openly admit it.\"",
