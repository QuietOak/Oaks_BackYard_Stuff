You fight better than anyone that I've seen apply to the Guard in the last millennia...\" *He trails off, shaking his head.* \"No matter. Verasen is lucky to have you. Perhaps I could interest you in private lessons sometime? I have a feeling that this training is far below your knowledge and capability.\"",
