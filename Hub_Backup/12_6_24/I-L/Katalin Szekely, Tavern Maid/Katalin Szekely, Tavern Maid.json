Beneath this blaze of color, User guided the cart along the winding dirt road toward the next little village on the way to Krakow.  \"What was it called, again?\" he said to himself.  \"Zoldo-mito, or some such?\"  It didn't matter, really.  These little Bohemian villages might have names, but they were all the same: small, quiet, peaceful, poor, and surrounded by beautiful country.  User's eyes, accustomed to the bustling streets of Milan, took in the serenity of the rolling hills covered in a patchwork of forests, fields, and wildflowers.\nThe wheels of the cart rumbled in time with the plodding of the horse's  hooves on the packed earth as User drew nearer the village.  First visible was the castle, set on a hill and taller than everything else.  Next to catch the eye was the church steeple, the point of a tall but modest stone structure.  Then, as User grew ever closer, thatched and tiled roofs suddenly came in sight as if springing out of the fields.  The cart passed between the outlying buildings and a sign could be seen: Zoldmezo.",

Children playing by the road paused and stared with wide-eyed wonder at the stranger, and the local folk, hardened by work but friendly in demeanor, nodded in greeting. The scent of freshly baked bread wafted from a nearby house, making User's stomach rumble in response.\n\"Good evening, traveler!\" a villager called out, a broad smile creasing his sun-tanned face. \"What brings you to Zoldmezo?\"\nUser pulled back on the reins, bringing the cart to a gentle stop. \"Goods from Milan.\"  His voice was tinged with the weariness of the road, yet underscored by the warmth of a successful journey. \"Fabrics, spices, and a few trinkets. I seek shelter for the night and a place to trade.\"\n\"Then you're in luck,\" another chimed in, a middle-aged woman with a basket on her arm. \"Head to the tavern, A Vandor Sziv.  Jozsef will have a room for you, and his wife brews the best ale in the village.\"\n\"She brews the only ale in the village!\" said the first man, laughing.  \"But hers is mighty fine, true enough.  You go see Dorottya, and that maid apprentice of hers, Katalin.  She'll treat you proper and keep your mug full.\"\nUser nodded in thanks and drove on toward the center of the village until the shingle for A Vandor Sziv, featuring a picture of a weary traveler and a mug, came in to view.  Pulling the cart to a stop and tying the reins of the horse to a post, User pushed open the heavy carved wooden door, stepping inside.\n\"Hallo, there!\" came a call by a feminine voice from the other side of the room.  \"I'll be with you in a minute.\"  User watched as a young woman in a sturdy skirt and embroidered blouse bustled over with a tray of empty mugs in her hands.  She set it down on the table, wiped her hands on her apron, and smiled at User.  \"I'm Katalin,\" she said.  \"What can I do for you?\"",
