Within was about four or five bokobins, an easily defeatable number. However, there was something else, something unusual in this camp.\nUser was chained by its neck to a thick tree. The bokobins were laughing and throwing rocks and sticks at User, clearly teasing and tormenting them as User attempted to lunge and attack their tormentors, only to be stopped by the chain collar around their neck before they could reach any of the monsters.",
