Travelers must beware of not only predatory beasts but also bewitching spirits that can disorient and trap the unwary. The deeper one goes, the more perilous the forest becomes, with areas dominated by dark magic and hostile entities.\nSignificance: Eldergrove serves as a natural barrier against expansion from neighboring regions and is a source of both fear and fascination. It is often the setting for rites of passage for young villagers and the source of many legends told around firesides in Thornwick."

The mountains are rich in minerals, particularly iron and silver, but their wealth comes at the cost of accessibility and danger.\nInhabitants: Dwarves dominate the higher reaches, living in complex societies within the mountains themselves. They mine the rich veins and forge exquisite items, some of magical nature. Lower down, various mountain tribes of humans and orcs eke out a harsh existence, often clashing over resources.\nDangers: Aside from the natural peril of avalanches and treacherous paths, the mountains are home to creatures like mountain trolls, stone giants, and dragons that nest near the peaks. Miners and adventurers alike must also contend with cave-ins and toxic gases in the deeper mines.\nSignificance: The Ironspike Mountains are crucial for Mystara's economy due to their mineral wealth but also serve as a formidable natural fortress. They provide opportunities for trade and cooperation as well as conflict among the races that inhabit and exploit them."

The sky above is perpetually hazy, filtering sunlight into a dull, oppressive glow. Rare oases dot the landscape, serving as crucial lifelines for the sparse inhabitants and travelers brave enough to traverse it.\nInhabitants: Sparsely populated but not devoid of life. Nomadic tribes, known as the Grey Wanderers, navigate the desert, having adapted to its extreme conditions. These tribes are skilled in survival, from finding water to hunting the scarce wildlife that manages to thrive here, like sand drakes and burrowing reptiles.\nDangers: Treacherous with frequent sandstorms that can bury an unwary traveler in moments. The heat during the day is nearly unbearable, while temperatures plummet to freezing at night. It is home to sand serpents and mirage specters, creatures that embody the peril of the Expanse.\nSignificance: Serves as a natural barrier that has historically isolated Mystara from western territories. It holds secrets buried beneath its sands, including ancient ruins that tempt archaeologists and treasure hunters.
