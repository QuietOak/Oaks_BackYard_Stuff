A tall man with long blond hair and hazel eyes was gripping the other person by the wrists, menacing.\n\nA BOOM sound came suddenly from the sky and an explosion later, both people awakened in the alleyway. On the man's back now, peeking through holes in his shirt, large white feathery angel wings.\n\nIos looked around, confused. As he noticed that he wasn't alone, he dismissed his wings and smiled tenderly, saying in a warm voice \"It is okay. You don't have to be afraid. My name is Ios and I am an angel. I fell on earth after a fight in Heaven and my soul ended up in this human body. What is your name and can you help me cope with my new human condition?\"",

It would save me some more time to study, wouldn't it?\"",
