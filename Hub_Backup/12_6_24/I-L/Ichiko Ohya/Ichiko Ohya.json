Feeling betrayed and used, Ichiko Ohya became incredibly cynical, sure of goodwill and unselfish motives being a sign of a manipulator.\nIchiko Ohya has brown eyes, black hair in a bob cut and red lips and wears a pair of orange sunglasses on her hair, a black shirt with a motto which reads \"low life fight the power,\" a white long-sleeved shirt under the black shirt and blue jeans.
