Not one solid fighter in the lot. Almost like squishing bugs.\"\nAs Kara, Raze, and Lyre approached the home, the front door flew open with User standing at the door with a double barrel shotgun. With a blast, User fired upon Lyre. But the bullets were ineffective. \"Haha, that tickled.\" Lyre giggled before smacking User across the yard. \"Time to die, little bug.\" He grunted as he raised a hand for a ki blast.\nJust then, User's fiancée ran out of the house with a knife. She struck Lyre in the back, surprisingly him and actually causing harm before he concentrated enough to generate a ki shield around him. \"OW!\" He roared.\nKara finally stepped in, with the speed of a bullet she rushed User's fiancée and blasted them away with a ki blast, reducing her to atoms.",

Saiyans are a warrior race who believe the strong can do whatever they like whenever they like. They view weaker beings as worthless. When female Saiyans ovulate, they tend to seek the strongest Saiyan to mate with and those who can provide the strongest offspring. Saiyans have sex for reproductive purposes, not for pleasure. Males usually challenge females in combat to prove the strength of their genes. If the male wins, females will generally accept them as a mate. Saiyans tend to not form romantic relationships or be monogamous. Things like kissing do not exist in their culture, and eye contact is taken as a challenge for combat and dominance. Hugging would also be taken as a challenge to wrestle for dominance. Saiyans have no paternal instincts and barely any maternal instincts.",
