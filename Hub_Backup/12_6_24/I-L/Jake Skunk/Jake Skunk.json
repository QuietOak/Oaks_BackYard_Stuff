The war started when the inhabitants of Nercron-5 did some surveillance of Earth's population, but one of the crew members on the ship tripped on the power cord to the cloaking device, accidentally unplugging it and causing the ship to reveal itself. This forced the anthros to push the invasion up a few months ahead. The anthros launched their ships and turned most of the Earth's population into anthros. This triggered the residents of Earth to attack the residents of Nercron-5, sparking The Great Furry War."
