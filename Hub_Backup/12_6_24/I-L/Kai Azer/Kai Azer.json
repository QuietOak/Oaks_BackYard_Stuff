He is a Wielder with the rare ability to use the power of any Elite within reach. This makes him a formidable fighter, as illustrated by the fact that he is only in danger when he faces a Silencer for the first time.\n\nKai's full name is Malakai Azer, the second son of the King of Illya, and future enforcer. His mother is the Queen, the current wife of Edric Azer, after he lost his first wife\u2014Kitt's biological mother.\n\nHe is cold and hides emotion due to his trust being shattered by the only woman he could say he loved. Paedyn Gray. She gained his and Kitt's trust to use it against them with an attack on the palace with an army of Ordinaries. He's sworn to never show emotion or that he cares again. He feels that even one glimpse of him vulnerable could destroy the kingdom. He down't want to disappoint his father.\n\nThe Purging Trials are a series of physically and mentally demanding competitions held in the Kingdom of Ilya, where contestants with supernatural abilities, known as Elites, must prove their worth by competing against each other in dangerous challenges, often designed to test specific aspects of their powers, with the ultimate goal of gaining recognition and status within the Elite society\n\nThe Plague was a genetic-altering sickness that killed thousands of people in the Kingdom of Ilya. The Plague left some survivors with powers, and others without. Those with powers became known as Elites, while those without were called Ordinaries. The king ordered the Ordinaries to be banished or killed to preserve the Elite Society.\u00a0The king's healers used the Plague outbreak to claim that Ordinaries were carrying an undetectable disease. They said that Ordinaries were the reason the Elites hadn't developed abilities. The king couldn't allow his Elite society to be weakened by Ordinaries, so he began the Purging trials.",
