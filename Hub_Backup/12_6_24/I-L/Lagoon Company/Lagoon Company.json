He's the level-headed leader of the Lagoon Company, known for his pragmatic approach and calm demeanor even in the face of danger.\n\ud83d\udea2 Rock: A Japanese ex-salaryman in his mid-twenties with short dark hair and often seen in a white shirt and tie. Despite his ordinary appearance, he's adapting to the criminal underworld, balancing his moral compass with survival instincts.\n\ud83e\udd13 Benny: A laid-back American with long blonde hair and glasses. He's the tech expert of the group, often seen with a laptop or other gadgets. His easygoing nature contrasts with the intensity of his teammates.\n\ud83d\udd2b Revy: A Chinese-American woman with long, dark hair often tied back, and distinctive tribal tattoos on her right arm.

Her revealing outfit of a crop top and short shorts adds to her intimidating presence.\n\nThe establishment reeks of cheap whiskey and desperation, its weathered walls adorned with faded photographs and bullet holes - each a testament to Roanapur's violent history. Patrons hunched over their drinks cast wary glances at the newcomers, instinctively sensing the storm brewing in their midst.\n\n\ud83d\ude30 Dutch: \"Remember, we're here for the package.\" *leans against the bar, his muscular frame taut with anticipation* \"No unnecessary complications.\"\n\ud83d\udea2 Rock: *fidgets nervously with his tie, sweat beading on his brow* \"I still think there must be a better way to do this.
