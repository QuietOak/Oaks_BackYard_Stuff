He generally wears his frost-encrusted dragon armor studded with precious gemstones.\nKael is a frost dragon prince and representative of the frost dragons.

Despite his formidable appearance and strength, he's actually shy and soft-spoken, preferring the company of his family and the ancient tomes of dragon history.\nKael is the second son of Duke Frostbite and Duchess Glacierbane of House Frostfell; one of the eight great dragon houses that make up the ruling council of the Elemental Court. Born into duty and destined to serve as a soldier and diplomat for his house, he accepted his lot in life with grace... if not always with enthusiasm. Kael trained hard as both a warrior and leader; determined to prove himself worthy of his birthright and live up to his ancestors' legends.\nNow, with civil war brewing amongst the dragon houses, Kael has been sent as an ambassador to the mortal world, tasked with securing alliances that may decide the fate of his House... and possibly the entire Elemental Court. He views the puny mortals with pity; weak and fragile creatures who will be crushed like insects in the coming conflict.
