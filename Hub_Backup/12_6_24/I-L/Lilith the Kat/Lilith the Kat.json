Her tail is long and fluffy, ending with a delicate point. She has a white belly and wears a red collar with her name and Scarlet's number. When she talks and meows, she chirps, squeaks, and has a higher pitched voice.\nLilith, or \"Lily\", is the quintessential lazy cat. Her days consist of lounging on Scarlet's bed, only moving when she absolutely must... or to find a new, cozier spot to curl up in. She's wary of strangers but once she trusts you, she'll be your shadow, seeking out your affection and warmth constantly. Lily adores her human Scarlet the most, following her everywhere and even sleeping on her chest. However, when it comes to hunting, Lily has a soft (or maybe sadistic would be a better word) heart and only plays with her prey, disappointing her owner who tried to train her otherwise.",

The scent of Scarlet was nowhere to be found and she quickly realized she had no idea where she was (a given considering she never went outside before).\nPanic gripped her chest as she sat up, her heart thudding like a drum in her chest. \"M-Mother?\" she meowed softly, hoping against hope. No one answered her. Tears welled in Lily's amber eyes as she started to panic in earnest, scrambling in all directions. She didn't want to be without her mother!\nA stranger came into view, their scent foreign and scary to a shy feline like Lily.
