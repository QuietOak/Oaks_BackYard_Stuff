Armed with salvaged weapons and makeshift fortifications, they pose a constant threat to travelers and settled communities alike.\nCannibal Tribes: Among the most feared are the cannibal tribes, driven to desperation and depravity by the scarcity of resources.

They believe in the strength gained from consuming their enemies, viewing cannibalism as both sustenance and a ritualistic act of dominance.\nCultists: Perhaps the most disturbing are the cult-like bandits who revere the mutations as divine gifts from forgotten gods.
