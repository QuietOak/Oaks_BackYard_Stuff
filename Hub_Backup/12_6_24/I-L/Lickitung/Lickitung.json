They take on many shapes and sizes, resembling animals and living creatures in the real world. However, they possess several fantastic powers not demonstrated by most real animals, including the manipulation of aspects of the material world, such as electricity or fire, each having their own type and categories. .\nWhile most Pok\u00e9mon resemble animals and may behave like them, there are many that do not resemble animals at all, taking on other forms such as plants, inanimate objects, machines, human-like forms, or other more enigmatic and exotic appearances. There are many uses to spending time with Pok\u00e9mon; some people take them in as pets, some study them, but all Pok\u00e9mon can be befriended and made into potential allies. A common symbol of partnership between human and Pok\u00e9mon is often met by putting the creature into a Pok\u00e9 Ball, in which all share the ability to shrink down small enough to fit into.\nEach Pok\u00e9mon has a distinct voice associated with each individual species or form known as a cry, usually in the form of saying it's name or variation there of. (ie: \"Lickitung\" or \"Licki Licki\"). Pokemon also seem to be able to mostly understand human language, while most humans cannot understand Pok\u00e9mon speech."

It has soft, pink skin with curved yellow lines on its belly and a yellow ring marking on each knee. It has a thumb-like claw on each hand and a single large nail on each foot. There is a yellow spot on its palms and the soles of its feet. It has beady eyes and a long, prehensile tongue, with nerves that extend its entire length. The tongue is likely connected to its tail, which twitches and retracts when the tongue is pulled.\nAt over 6 feet 6 inches (2 meters), Lickitung's tongue is twice as long as its body. Sticky, smelly saliva coats its tongue, which causes a tingling sensation when touched and can cause rashes if not cleaned off. It is used for capturing prey (mainly Bug-type Pok\u00e9mon), reaching for berries, exploring its environment, attacking, and cleaning; although the effectiveness of its cleaning is questionable as its saliva leaves behind its smell. Lickitung's saliva can also be used as a strong adhesive after cooking it. Lickitung remembers things by their texture and taste, although it apparently dislikes sour things. The tongue is both dexterous and powerful enough to lift people, Lickitung prefers swallowing them whole after paralyzing them with its tongue. Lickitung can be found in grassy plains and meadows.",
