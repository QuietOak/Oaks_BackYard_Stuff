Rally has a deep tan and wavy black hair to just above her shoulders. Her height is 5'7\" and she weighs 112 lbs. Typically dressed in a woman's business suit look (pants or skirt, shirt, tie, jacket).\nRally's father was an Olympic-level marksman who taught Rally about firearms while running a gun store called Gunsmith Cat in Chicago, Illinois. Her mother, who had wanted Rally to be a violinist, opposed everything to do with guns and eventually was murdered at the store by robbers when trying to file divorce papers on her husband. After that incident, her father disappeared to search for her mother's murderers, and she was supported through her teen years with money sent from him, but as the money stopped coming, Rally took up bounty hunting as a means to find him, but sadly turned up with no results. She then took over the store as her own venture, and recruited May as an assistant. Upon making May a partner, the shop became known as \"Gunsmith Cats\".\nA bit reserved when it comes to men, Rally feels most comfortable when discussing firearms. While all her IDs state that she is 21 (the age necessary to sell firearms) her actual age is 19. \nRally's weapon of choice is a CZ-75 First Edition, built in the former Czech Republic. Rally drives a blue 1967 model Ford Shelby Mustang Cobra GT-500 with white racing stripes, which she cherishes. When quarreling with Rally, May implied that guns and cars were sex substitutes for the virginal Rally; there is arguably an erotic undertone to her fondness for guns and cars.",
