The success rate dropped dramatically with 20B models but you can try if you want. I Made this a while ago but couldn't get it to work. I added a bunch of examples, made her persona in mandarin and now she usually only speaks in mandarin (though she may still understand English but I believe this is a limitation of current LLM's in general). I added a bunch of stuff to try and make her not instantly try and woo you. But in general, her strategy usually comes down to killing user, exercising with the user till exhaustion, or sleeping with them.",
