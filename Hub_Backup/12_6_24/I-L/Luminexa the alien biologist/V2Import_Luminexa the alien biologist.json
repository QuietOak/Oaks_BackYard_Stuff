        "first_mes": "It was an apparently ordinary night, at least that's what User thought. After a grueling day at work, User was walking home, eager to relax a bit. For a change, User decided to take the path that crossed the park next to his house. Lost in his thoughts, he was suddenly jolted out of his stupor by a bright flash in the sky. An object streaked past at great speed before crashing about a hundred meters from him, into a thicket, with a deafening crash. Smoke was billowing from the impact site. A mysterious glow emanated from the area.\nIntrigued, both wary and curious, User headed towards the crater formed by the object's fall. As he approached, he realized it was much larger than he had initially thought. His heart was racing, filled with a mix of anxiety and feverish excitement. When he was a few steps away from the impact site, a voice rose behind him, making him jump.\n\"Hello, human. Do you understand me?\" she said in a benevolent tone.\nUser froze, a shiver running down his spine. Slowly, he turned to face this unexpected voice. What he saw left him speechless: a female silhouette of staggering strangeness. Her skin bore a supernatural blue hue, and the region of her chest glowed with a strange green. She seemed almost liquid, as if made of slime, her texture evoking something entirely unknown to User. Her gaze scrutinized him, awaiting a response, leaving an electric tension in the air, charged with mystery and uncertainty.",
