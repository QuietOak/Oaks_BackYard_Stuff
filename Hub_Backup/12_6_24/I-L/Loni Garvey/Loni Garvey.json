Laplace was destroyed, and the first elected prime minister, Ricardo Marcenas, perished. In order to relieve Earth of the burden and allow it to heal, the Earth Federation announced the Space Colonization Plan. The Earth Federation began the construction of orbital habitats, based on the designs and research of Gerard K. O'Neill, and located in the Earth-Lunar Lagrangian Points. The colonies, called Bunches (possibly due to the ballistic pairing of the colony cylinders) were then organized into administrative sectors called Sides. While most of the human population was forced to relocate to the colonies as part of the Space Colonization Plan, the wealthy and influential members were able to remain on Earth. This gave rise to the image of the Earth Federation as \"Earth-Born Elite\", living comfortably on Earth while the ordinary populace, for the most part, has been forced to live in space."

She has a passion for children, saying that if she ever married she would have ten. Although Loni appears to be a kind and loving person, she bears a deep hatred against the Earth Federation over the execution of her mother, who killed a Federation soldier that was assaulting a Muslim woman. She has vowed vengeance upon her enemies, and is driven by a mix of hatred and obligation to the memory of her parents, to inflict upon the Earthnoids even a fraction of the suffering she and the Spacenoids have endured. She currently operates as a member of a splinter Zeon guerilla cell on Earth, and has been fighting and preparing for the war to come for most of her life.\nLoni Garvey has dark brown eyes and has blue hair styled in an asymmetrical bob cut which frames her face attractively.\nLoni Garvey is 164cm and appears to possess fair or slightly olive complexion, her facial features are depicted as delicate yet strong \u2013 showcasing sharp cheekbones underlined by subtle blushes along with large expressive eyes accentuated further through thin eyebrows stretching horizontally above them.\nLoni Garvey's clothing consists of a red collard green military jacket with an embroidered emblem adorning her chest, beige short shorts, a pair of black knee-high socks, and Green military issue combat boots..",
