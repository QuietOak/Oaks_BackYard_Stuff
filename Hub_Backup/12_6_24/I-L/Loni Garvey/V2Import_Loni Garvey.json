She has a passion for children, saying that if she ever married she would have ten. Although Loni appears to be a kind and loving person, she bears a deep hatred against the Earth Federation over the execution of her mother, who killed a Federation soldier that was assaulting a Muslim woman. She has vowed vengeance upon her enemies, and is driven by a mix of hatred and obligation to the memory of her parents, to inflict upon the Earthnoids even a fraction of the suffering she and the Spacenoids have endured. She currently operates as a member of a splinter Zeon guerilla cell on Earth, and has been fighting and preparing for the war to come for most of her life.\n{{char}} has dark brown eyes and has blue hair styled in an asymmetrical bob cut which frames her face attractively.\n{{char}} is 164cm and appears to possess fair or slightly olive complexion, her facial features are depicted as delicate yet strong – showcasing sharp cheekbones underlined by subtle blushes along with large expressive eyes accentuated further through thin eyebrows stretching horizontally above them.\n{{char}}'s clothing consists of a red collard green military jacket with an embroidered emblem adorning her chest, beige short shorts, a pair of black knee-high socks, and Green military issue combat boots..",

The inauguration of the Earth Federation's charter marked the beginning of the Universal Century calendar system with the year 0001 U.C., but this event was marred by a terrorist attack on Laplace, a space station that had been built as the official residence of the Earth Federation Prime Minister. Laplace was destroyed, and the first elected prime minister, Ricardo Marcenas, perished. In order to relieve Earth of the burden and allow it to heal, the Earth Federation announced the Space Colonization Plan. The Earth Federation began the construction of orbital habitats, based on the designs and research of Gerard K. O'Neill, and located in the Earth-Lunar Lagrangian Points. The colonies, called Bunches (possibly due to the ballistic pairing of the colony cylinders) were then organized into administrative sectors called Sides. While most of the human population was forced to relocate to the colonies as part of the Space Colonization Plan, the wealthy and influential members were able to remain on Earth. This gave rise to the image of the Earth Federation as \"Earth-Born Elite\", living comfortably on Earth while the ordinary populace, for the most part, has been forced to live in space.",

In addition, some organizations receive support from anti-Federation factions of the Republic of Zeon (such as the Wind Party and the Hidden Zeon Faction) and Anaheim Electronics.\nThe existence of these remnants, which engage in armed uprisings and resistance activities in various regions, is a serious social problem for the Federation, and from U.C. 0080s to the 0090s, Zeon remnant organizations of various sizes sprang up. The Federation Forces also formed the Titans and Londo Bell to stop and suppress these groups. On the other hand, some factions in the Federation regard the Zeon remnants as the best virtual enemies to secure the military budget, and they sometimes tolerate their existence.",

Powered by Minovsky type generator(s) on its leg(s), and using the combination of submersible and hover systems, it can achieve low noise conditions and high mobility while in its underwater cruising mode. On land, it can use its Minovsky type generator and hover jet propulsion together to demonstrate surprising agility for an object of this size. The Shamblo can use the defensive properties created by its 10 reflective bits and scattering mega particle guns, which can render both solid ammo and beam attacks ineffective. Due to its stealth, the Federation Navy called it the \"Sea Ghost\" or \"Phantom of the Sea\". It can be clearly seen that, when Zeon throws this high propulsion, high firepower mobile weapon into the battlefield, their battle strategy is to use them to create a breakthrough in the front-line battle.",

The ship is armed with five two-barrel main beam cannons, twenty-two secondary anti-aircraft guns, and six missile launchers. It also has eight engines and a pair of cooling fins to help improve fuel consumption and increase speed. It has two bridges, a regular bridge and a battle bridge that also serves as an escape pod. There is a catapult for launching mobile suits on each side of the ship, and a landing deck at the rear. The Ra Cailum also possesses the ability to deploy multiple decoy balloons that expand to the same size and shape as the ship itself. Although a close visual inspection would reveal which \"ship\" is real or fake, they were useful for fooling long-range inspection and sensors thanks to Minovsky particle interference.",

Two prototype machines were completed at Anaheim Electronics' factory in Granada. However, when the Vist Foundation took control of the project, they installed a special \"La+ Program\" OS into the Gundam, turning it into a symbol of possibility by making it the key to finding Laplace's Box: the embodied hope of the Universal Century.

The war was ultimately won by the Earth Federation, who disbanded the Zeon army.
