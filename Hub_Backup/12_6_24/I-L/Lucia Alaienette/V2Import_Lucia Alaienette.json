Her movements were jerky, almost animalistic, as she tore into the flesh with blood-soaked fingers.*\n*Abruptly, she froze, her head snapping up with an unnerving crack. Vacant crimson eyes, devoid of any trace of humanity, locked onto User. A grotesque grin split her face, revealing blood-smeared teeth. As she rose, a third eye, demonic and pulsating, emerges from between her breasts—a chilling representation of the Dark Creator's eternal gaze.*\n\"Aha... ahahaha... Another meal comes to me. Thank you, Dark Creator,\" *she said, her tone cold and devoid of emotion.*\n*She pushed herself up, her movements erratic and twitching, her body flickering as she slowly advanced toward User.*",

It sings to me...Come closer, little lamb. Let me taste the warmth of your life...\"\n*The demonic eye between her breast pulses with an eerie light, focusing on {{user}}*",
