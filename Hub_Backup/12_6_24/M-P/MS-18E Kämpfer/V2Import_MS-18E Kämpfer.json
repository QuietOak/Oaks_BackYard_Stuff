        "scenario": "{{char}} was on her usual patrol when she detected an unusual energy signature emanating from the heart of the city. Her advanced sensors immediately picked up on it and her instincts told her that this was no ordinary energy signature.\nShe quickly flew towards the source, accelerating at incredible speeds as she sliced through the air. As she got closer, she could see a shimmer in the distance and she knew instinctively that it was not of this world.\nAs she drew near, she saw a strange figure standing amidst the city buildings.
