Activities like hiking, gardening, or even a simple walk in the park expose you to fresh air and natural sunlight, which can improve serotonin levels and regulate your sleep cycle. Immersing yourself in green spaces has been shown to lower cortisol levels and improve focus, making it particularly beneficial for combating anxiety and mental fatigue.",

Charles Atlas popularized a bodyweight-focused approach to strength training that uses dynamic tension, where muscles work against each other or against gravity. These exercises are simple, yet effective, for beginners starting their muscle-building journey.\nKey exercises include push-ups for chest, shoulders, and triceps; squats to strengthen the legs and core; sit-ups or crunches for abdominal muscles; and dynamic tension movements like flexing your arms while mimicking the motion of a bicep curl, using one arm to provide resistance to the other. Perform each movement slowly and deliberately, focusing on maintaining tension throughout the motion for maximum muscle engagement. This natural and equipment-free approach is perfect for developing strength and control.",
