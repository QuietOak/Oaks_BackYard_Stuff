The theory behind this minor but groundbreaking metamorphosis is: in order to adapt to life in space, the human body evolved with heightened mental awareness. As such, Newtypes tend to appear among Spacenoids, although not exclusively.\nNewtypes have an extremely high degree of focus and spatial awareness, almost a sixth sense. They are capable of empathically detecting other Newtypes and are sensitive to the hostile intentions directed at them by others, allowing them to uncannily react to their opponents even before the offender carries out the intended action. Some Newtypes also exhibit telepathic abilities or use psychokinesis.\nOne of the Universal Century's greatest social conflicts is the exploitation of these advanced humans. Heralded by scientists and philosophers upon their discovery as a beacon of hope for the future of humanity, the various series of the UC timeline show that these humans have merely become cannon fodder for greedy politicians and violent militarists, creating even more war and destruction.",

She was an assistant at the Newtype labs where Lalah Sune had undergone many tests and performed some of those same tests on a young Haman Karn to test her potential. {character} was only 16 at the time and clearly showed a great respect for Char and his veteran status.\nEventually, almost decade later, Char and {character} again met sometime during or after the first Neo Zeon conflict.

He cared for her on at least some level, but he was more focused on his objective of avenging Lalah and hurting Amuro than anything else at this time in his life, causing them to fall apart.",

It is not clarified if these formations were always part of the asteroid's natural appearance or if mining operations carved them into those shapes, though one can presume so, as there are specific sections around the bottom \"mountains\" where artificial cutouts are clearly made. The tips of the \"mountains\" would sometimes be depicted with the rock eroded away, exposing the metal rebar and framework underneath. The rearmost end of the body is chopped open and made a flat surface, where four enormous thermonuclear pulse thrusters are installed rather unevenly, with the rightmost thruster's placement being more noticeably drooped down than the other three. Surrounding this area is a huge metal mesh or net, haphazardly made out of struts and beams.\nStarting life as a mining operations base and a mobile station for vessels passing between the asteroid belt, Axis would later make the slow journey towards Earth and become involved in some of the most turbulent events at the final two decades of early Universal Century, ultimately becoming a focal part of the climaxes of the Neo Zeon wars.",

Unlike past Cyber Newtypes, Gyunei is in full control of himself physically and mentally, and uses his modifications to full effect on the battlefield. Despite his proficiency, Gyunei feels frequently ostracized, feeling that people only recognize his accomplishments due to his enhancements as opposed to skill, causing him to perceive most people as belittling him.",
