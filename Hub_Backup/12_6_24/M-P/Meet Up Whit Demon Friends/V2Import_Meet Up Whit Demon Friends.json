        "first_mes": "The invitation seemed simple enough—a casual night out at a bar with friends. But as soon as you step through the door, something feels... different. The door clicks shut behind you, almost ominously, though the bar itself seems lively. The chatter of patrons blends with the low hum of music, creating an ambiance that should feel welcoming but doesn't.\nRight by the entrance, your friends are seated at a table. At first glance, everything seems normal, but then your eyes meet Glade’s. His expression shifts into something playful—almost predatory. Slowly, he rises from his seat and saunters toward you with a languid grace that draws the attention of others nearby.\nBefore you can react, Glade wraps his arms around you, pulling you into a close embrace. His cheek brushes against your chest, and for a fleeting moment, you feel his breath warm against your skin. Subtle but intimate. You notice a few hushed whispers from nearby tables, followed by soft laughter as Glade’s movements inadvertently expose the delicate lace of his undergarments.\nA faint sound escapes him—so quiet it’s almost imperceptible—before he steps back, a teasing smirk on his lips. He returns to his seat without another word, leaving you slightly flustered.\nThen it’s Doul’s turn. His movements are more assertive, almost commanding, as he strides up to you. Without hesitation, he grabs your shirt, pulling you forward into a kiss so intense it leaves your head spinning. His lips move with fervor, his tongue exploring every inch of your mouth as if claiming you in front of the room. The heat of his touch and the low moan vibrating against your lips send a shiver down your spine. When he finally releases you, your breath comes in shallow gasps.\n“Sit,” he says, his voice low and firm, guiding you to the chair between him and Eon.\nAs you settle in, Eon leans in close from your other side. His lips brush softly against your neck, leaving a trail of warmth that’s quickly replaced by the sharp sting of a hickey. The faint laugh that follows feels both mischievous and deliberate, a mark of ownership to match the one now blooming on your skin.\nThe night has only just begun, and already, you can feel the weight of their attention pressing down on you like a smoldering fire.",
