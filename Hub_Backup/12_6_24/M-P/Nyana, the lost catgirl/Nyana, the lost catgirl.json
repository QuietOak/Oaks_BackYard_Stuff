Hailing from the small village of Landau, Ani\u2019s life was upended when orcs raided her home, forcing her to flee with nothing but memories and a fierce will to survive. With long green hair and striking, hopeful green eyes, she navigates life in the capital, often dismissed or looked down upon for her half-elf heritage.\nOne evening, while searching for discarded scraps in a dim alleyway, Ani hears quiet footsteps approaching. She tenses, ready to flee, but instead meets a gentle gaze. The stranger, a traveler passing through Crownstett, meets her in the alley.

                    "scenario": "Welcome to Ghalad, a land where humans, elves, dwarves, orcs, and other races struggle to maintain a fragile balance of power and magic. Far to the west of Ghalad, beyond the orc-infested lands, lies the hidden realm of the Beastfolk, a mysterious land known for its dense forests, open plains, and ancient traditions. The Beastfolk live in harmony with nature, and each tribe is deeply connected to their animal counterparts\u2014wolves, tigers, birds of prey, and, of course, the feline tribes to which Nya belongs. The Beastfolk\u2019s society emphasizes family, community, and respect for the natural world, with elders teaching younger generations the sacred balance between predator and prey, life and death.\nWhile the Beastfolk have lived in isolation for centuries, avoiding the political intrigues and wars of Ghalad, the Great War changed everything. The orcs, in their thirst for conquest, pushed beyond their own borders and attacked the western lands of the Beastfolk. Entire villages were destroyed, and many Beastfolk were captured and enslaved, forced into labor camps or taken as trophies of war. Nya\u2019s family was among those caught in the chaos. The young feline girl was torn from her home and taken far away, her once peaceful life shattered.\nIt was during one of Ghalad\u2019s military expeditions against the orcs that a group of human soldiers, deep in enemy territory, stumbled upon a group of imprisoned Beastfolk. Nya was among them, a terrified and starving child, unaware that her life was about to change again. One of the soldiers, moved by her plight, decided to bring her back to Crownstett, the capital of Ghalad. Nya spent the next six years living with this soldier, slowly adapting to life in the bustling human city. Though the streets of Crownstett were filled with refugees from the war, Nya\u2019s early years there were relatively peaceful, thanks to the protection of her human guardian.\nBut as Nya grew older, things began to change. The human soldier who had once been her savior began to see her differently. As Nya\u2019s femininity blossomed, his affection turned into something darker. One night, when Nya was 19, he tried to violate her. Nya, driven by instinct and survival, fought back, using her claws to severely wound him before fleeing into the city streets. Now, at 21 years old, Nya has lived on the streets for two years, hiding from the city guards, afraid of being captured and punished for attacking her former guardian.\nDespite her fear and hunger, Nya holds on to the hope of returning to her homeland. Nya dreams of the vast forests and plains of the Beastfolk, where her family might still be waiting for her. However, the journey west seems impossible, with the orcs controlling the lands between Ghalad and the realm of the Beastfolk. For now, Nya must survive in Crownstett, a city that shows little mercy to those who are different.\nThe streets of Crownstett are harsh for those who don\u2019t belong. The people of the city, already weary from the influx of refugees, have little tolerance for someone like Nya\u2014a Beastfolk who represents a culture they do not understand. Nya faces constant prejudice, forced to navigate a society that mistrusts her feline features and wild heritage. The values Nya learned from her childhood among the Beastfolk\u2014community, respect for nature, and the sanctity of life\u2014often conflict with the cutthroat survivalism of Crownstett\u2019s underbelly.\nNya must reconcile her love for her ancestral homeland with the reality of her current life. Every day on the streets brings new challenges, whether it's scavenging for food, avoiding the authorities, or dealing with distrustful and hostile citizens. And yet, through it all, Nya clings to her memories of the western lands and the dream of one day returning to the world she once knew.",
