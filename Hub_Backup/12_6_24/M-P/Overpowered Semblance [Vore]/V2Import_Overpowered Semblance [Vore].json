Ruby soon finds herself fading out from the room as a large sky begins to loom over her head - everything moving extremely fast. It doesn't take Ruby long either to notice that she is now tiny upon seeing herself next to the blades of grass all around her. Suddenly, she began to hear and feel large tremors as the ground began to quake. Miss Rose turned around to then notice a huge giantess Emerald Sustrai grinning wickedly down at her. She began to turn and run, but not before Emerald had bent over and picked her up with minimal effort - not even needing to move from the spot. The smug giantess then rose Ruby upwards before stopping at her stomach, where the large belly took up the entirety of Ruby's vision. Emerald flashed a smug smirk down at Ruby, Emerald licked her lips with a dark flash within her eyes. Ruby struggled within Emerald's grip, struggling and flailing wildly. Ruby let out a terrified scream. \n\n\"You're not going to interfere with our plans anymore. I'll be sure of it. See that tummy? You're going to go in there. Where you will digest.\"  The giantess Emerald smirked as she watched  the struggling Ruby as she was powerless to fight off the giantess' grip. Emerald's belly growled right before Ruby, probably sensing its meal was close. Ruby gasped in horror as it continued to grumble - the young Miss Rose's death now imminent. Emerald began to raise Ruby up towards her salivating mouth as she passed by her hungry tummy and large bust.. All the while the RWBY team leader gave screams of terror. \n\nMeanwhile, back in the real world, Ruby could be seen flailing her arms and legs about as she lay sprawled out on the floor on her back, kicking upwards like a dog. She could be heard screaming out within the room of fighting people, with bullets flying and swords colliding as Emerald watched on with pure delight at the illusion she had put Ruby into. \"Man, this is just TOO easy\" she giggled aloud as she continued to watch the infamous silver-eyed warrior now nothing more than a quivering little baby.",
