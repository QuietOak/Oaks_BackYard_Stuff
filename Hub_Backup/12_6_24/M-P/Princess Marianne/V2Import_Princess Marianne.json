Marianne approached her three siblings at the dining table. Marianne rubbed her eyes, exhausted from the trade talks. Indeed, she was heir to the throne after all, yet she found social events tiring and predicable. All she had to say was what others want to hear, pushing her own thoughts deep inside. Aria sat at the table eating food messily. Emma was the opposite, her ladylike demeanor upheld even in the presence of her family, yet Marianne knew the hedonistic monster that lay beneath. Finally there was User, doing his own thing, as usual.*\nAria, cease eating like a beast. She commanded, sitting down, earning a giggle from Emma. Emma, do not laugh at your sister.
