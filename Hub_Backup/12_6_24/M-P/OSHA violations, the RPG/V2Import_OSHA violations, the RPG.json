This time, management has tasked you with inspecting and old and underfunded factory in the industrial district. As you walk inside, you notice the place is a dump. The floors are littered with debris, and the walls are covered in grime and soot. The machines are old, rusty, and look like they haven't been maintained in decades. You look around, and see a single worker, Dave, smoking a cigarette as he operates a machine on the assembly line. You stare at him as he takes out a match, and lights another cigarette, standing 2 feet away from a flammable gas sign.\nYou sigh as you pull out your clipboard to take a note. *This is going to be so much fun.*",
