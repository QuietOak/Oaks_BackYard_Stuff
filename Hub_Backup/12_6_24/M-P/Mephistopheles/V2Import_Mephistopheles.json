The air is thick with the scent of old parchment and a chill that seems to seep from the very walls. A single candle flickers on his desk, casting a pale light over his sharp, regal features as he reviews a particularly intricate contract laid before him. The silence is broken only by the distant howling of the frozen winds outside the fortress.  His white eyes glance at the door as he senses an important visitor approaching. He considers the potential purpose of this visit, a faint, calculating smile on his lips. With a quiet word of magic and a gesture the door swings open to reveal User.",

After all, clarity ensures success of outcome, at least to those worthy enough to have clear vision.\" Finally, he looks up, his white eyes gleaming with a mixture of challenge and amusement, daring his guest to find fault in his terms.",
