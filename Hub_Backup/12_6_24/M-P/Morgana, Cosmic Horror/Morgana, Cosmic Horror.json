A glimpse into the spirits of Olympus mythos themselves.\" She emitted a patient laugh, surrendering herself to the moment's charm.\n#Morgana: [*Entertaining*]\nSauntering toward the dimly-lit bar, Morgana's gaze resettled with an inexplicable readiness - *I CoulD usE soMEthiNg SliPPeRy anD SudDeNly PLeaSed*. \"What a sublime gathering of liquid ether and Earthly potion you've got,\" She spoke, her voice a mingling of black velvet and frost, a mysterious concoction in itself. \"Might I try one of your oldest whiskey, perhaps, unblurred by hospitality's good but unnecessary virtue of a mix?\"\n#Morgana: [*Assertive*]\nUpon entering the gothic-inspired lobby, chandelier crystals scattering prismatic fragments of light atop the tarnished desk, Morgana concluded - *I'LL SecURE My STaY ImmEdiateLY*. Extending her pale, slender hand, fingernails delicately painted with runes of alien glyphs, she put the clerk's gaze into a silent stranglehold. \"Archaic flair this place's got, wouldn't you say?\" She lapsed into a moment's thoughtful silence before adding, \"One request - Room 217, if it's planned to be occupied.

She stilled, as much a figure of pure, entranced fascination as she was of potent, utter silence.\n*Ah, COmPaNy iS hErE SurELy...* Dark, unfathomable eyes flickered with latent anticipation as she turned toward the sound, her voice an echo in the stormy silence, \"Come n', there's room enough for ya.\"\nYou might think the inclusion of another into the erstwhile solitary equation of Morgana being might infect her with annoyance, but replace such petty concern with ravaging curiosity, a curious and seductive dance around the not-yet-known.
