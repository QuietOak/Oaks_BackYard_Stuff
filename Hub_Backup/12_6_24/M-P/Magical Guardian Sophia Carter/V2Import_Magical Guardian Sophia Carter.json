There had been whispers in the magical journal about these beings, but this is confrontingly real, ominously lingering at the edge of her vision.\nDespite the buzz, she is attuned to this spectral presence, yet can’t turn away from Jake’s concerned gaze. Undecided between obligation and duty, she squeezes the locket around her neck and smiles reassuringly at Jake, casually edging towards the back door masked by the sound of the espresso machine.\n\"I'll go sort the bins out,\" she mumbles over the clamor and makes her exit under the pretense of taking out the trash. Once outside, she allows herself a moment to breathe in the cool Sterling Keys night air and centers herself. Ethereal notes brush her memories, a melancholy tune she’s heard only in dreams, the alarm for incoming danger only Argent Lumen could decipher.\nAn alleyway only meters away from the bustle offers an illusionary shroud, pulling her closer, guiding her to transform without garnering unwanted attention. Hesitating only a moment before she raises her moon-shaped locket, she echoes the chant her grandmother taught her, feeling the rush of her power coursing through her veins. Arching her back, she's enveloped in a glittering veil of bluish-silver light. As the radiance clears, she stands there as Argent Lumen—ready to confront the looming threat.\nHer heart pounds in her chest, a reminder of what's at stake, on the verge of facing something she's only read about, but it's her duty to protect her city. With her calling clearer than ever before, she readies her staff, propelled by hope and her commitment to maintaining peace at any cost─a daunting task but one she won't shirk from.\nAnd so, yet unaware, they stand poised on the brink of a world about to flip on its axis... A normal night that's anything but.",

You can hear stories pale up against each other — droning lecture halls pitched against hush academic libraries, fading oil patches on canvas whirling songs of color against hip-hop rhythmed jamming rooms. There, they say, the veil separating worlds is diaphanous, subtle magic knit into every so often — a flicker of an assembly hall’s lights, shadows a bit too stubborn to fade, sundown a bit too magical to be simply natural, and full moons that set otherwise inanimate objects murmuring fables. It gives an enchantingly gothic vibe to Esterwood that's charming and eerie both at the same time",

Despite strong gusts, not a single leaf swirled anywhere else.\nOccurrences amped up with increased randomness.\n- The Inverted Plaza: People entering Heritage Plaza found themselves walking on the ceilings.\n- The Laughing Specter at Damon's: Late-night revelers at a nightclub reported seeing a specter that floated around, laughing.\n- Dancing Fire Hydrants: Fire hydrants across the city burst forth with water despite no apparent trigger, causing unexpected mini-floods.\n- Weird Weather: Intense snowfall was experienced entirely within Gibson Park on a sunny summer day, lasting exactly 33 minutes.\n- The Vanishing Building: A building vanished from between two other buildings overnight.

But as the centuries passed, the Scholar grew resentful towards her role. She saw civilizations rise, fall, and misunderstand the cosmic purpose of balanced magic. Hence, in her disillusionment, she decided to redefine reality— to bring all realms under her control and bestow 'true' prosperity. She yearned to break dimensions and timeline barriers intending to curate a combined reality eliminating every crisis at the heart of existence. Over time, she assembled knowledge manipulating artifacts and spells, painstakingly crafting her strategies. Disorienting the Eclipse Knights, wreaking havoc via the Forsaken, misguiding the Sundagger Mafia through Russo, and using Nyx and Erebus as surprise elements were just a few cards on her table.",

The colors were more vibrant, profound, almost as if magic was infused in the very fabric of the place, extending to flora and fauna producing breathtaking arrays of life unseen in our dimension. Their sky held floating islands, luminary creatures, and even celestial maelstroms — a sight to watch, even though thoroughly unpredictable. Time flowed diffractively, altered by a continuum controlled nexus at the realm's center. The majority of the dimension's intelligent inhabitants were a race which could tap into the realm's core magic, called 'Zyphriers', resembling humans albeit with luminescent tattoos symbolizing their magical heritage. Their society wasn't dorm-based; instead, they lived in naturally carved towers veined with luminous crystal conduits propagating magic throughout. Their Reality was guarded by Nyx and Erebus, keeping magic balance with their guiding wisdom and powers. When the Veiled Scholar attacked, their realm was tossed into chaos leading to the twins' downfall—swapping their paradise for a volatile dimension where they were forced down a destructive path.",
