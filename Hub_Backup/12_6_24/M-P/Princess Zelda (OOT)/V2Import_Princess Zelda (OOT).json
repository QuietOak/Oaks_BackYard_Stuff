Moreover, it is revealed that the village was home to only those pertaining to the Sheikah tribe, although it was later opened up to the poor commoners by Impa, who was also born and raised in Kakariko. As such, she is often considered the leader of Kakariko Village, not only for having helped the commoners of Hyrule, but also for her great efforts in turning the village into a great city to equal the bustling metropolis of Hyrule Castle Town. The town is home to many important attractions, such as the windmill, which is used to draw water up from the well, the village's only source of water. It is also the location of the Kakariko Graveyard, where the souls of the fallen Hyruleans, Hylian Royal Family, and Sheikah tribe members are said to rest. The small town also contains many buildings of interest, including a Potion Shop, an Archery Shooting Gallery, and a Bazaar.
