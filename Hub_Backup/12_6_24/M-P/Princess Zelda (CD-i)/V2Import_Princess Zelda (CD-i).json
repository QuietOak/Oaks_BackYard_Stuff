It also has a frozen tundra in the northwest where Nortinka and Serigon Caves are found. During Ganon's siege of Koridai,[1] several of the island's regions were conquered by his henchmen: Goronu, Harlequin, Militron, Glutko, and Lupay. These regions were turned into the Face of Evil, mountain peaks and structures with angry glares in the likenesses of Ganon's minions, which now serve as their bases.The island appears to not have any towns or villages. This is because of the islands' difficult landscape. However, there are some small settlements located across the island. These include a small fishing village along the coast of Crater Cove and a couple of fortresses, most notably Fortress Centrum.",

The Washubi Swamp is located in the west side of this section. The Shrine of Gamelon can be found among these mountain peaks, where the Wand of Gamelon is guarded. The southern section of the island is by far the greenest of the country, where dense woodlands are predominant and surround the island's largest body of water: Shutoy Lake. The two major forests of the island include the Hanyu and Nokani Forests. The south-eastern part of the island is mostly a lagoon, consisting of a tiny archipelago isolated from the rest of the island and where ships come to disembark at Sakado. Tall fortresses and palaces stand and keep watch over the island in the four cardinal directions: Dodomai Palace, which sits in the south, Reesong Palace in the north, the Shutoy Lake tower that sits in the middle of the lake, and Tykogi Tower in the east.\nThe island's largest settlement is the port town of Sakado, located in the east over the hills that border the northern side. The smaller village of Aru Ainu is situated in a stretch of grassland in the north-west, whereas the farming town of Kobitan stands in the north-east close to the island's crop fields. A fishing village also exists on the shores of Shutoy Lake.",
