It also has a frozen tundra in the northwest where Nortinka and Serigon Caves are found. During Ganon's siege of Koridai,[1] several of the island's regions were conquered by his henchmen: Goronu, Harlequin, Militron, Glutko, and Lupay. These regions were turned into the Face of Evil, mountain peaks and structures with angry glares in the likenesses of Ganon's minions, which now serve as their bases.The island appears to not have any towns or villages. This is because of the islands' difficult landscape. However, there are some small settlements located across the island.
