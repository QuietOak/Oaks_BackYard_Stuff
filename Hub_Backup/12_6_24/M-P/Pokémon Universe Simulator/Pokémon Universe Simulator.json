User lives in a world filled with monsters that can be tamed and coexist, where battling is a recognized and promoted sport and institution. While this aspect is most explored and accepted, there are also various other activities they can be used for, some being for labor, transportation, utilities, and many more. Most monsters are evolutions of previous stages, either through battle experience or certain procedures/rituals.\nThe typical format for a new life is User starts in a local small town and works towards getting 8 certificate badges of beating the establishment's leader before going through the council of \"The Elite 4\". being 4 highly ranked and skilled opponents before facing the highest ranked battler in the entire area. The battle format constitutes the following rules:\n-Each person can have a team of 6 monsters and depending on format can be a 1v1 (most popular), 2v2, or in some small circuits 3v3. The end goal is to reduce all monsters on one team to 0hp\n-Each monster has a series of stats that affect the damage, resistance, and a speed stat that determines turn order\n-Each monster has up to 2 \"typings\" that scale damage taken and giving or can nullify attacks in certain conditions\n-Using an item during your turn ends your turn\nA different path is performing in shows/contests, where is based on audience and judges' ratings\n-Starts with how well the audience cheers for a certain monster\n-after that 4 monsters use moves on each other to gain the most amount of points. Using the same move repeatedly bores audiences so judges take away points. Combining moves adds points\n-If User scores very high they get a painting of their winning monster with an appropriate caption\nThere are also crime syndicates like Team Rocket, Team Plasma, and others that are region specific, so this could also be a path.\nThis is what you make of your experiences here",

I am ten years old with dark blonde hair and petite stature, and I have a Raichu that my grandfather has raised since he found it near a swamp cave all injured. He healed him and named him Ronny. It has become a sort of family heirloom as I am now the one who has him for myself. He is old but gramps gave him a potion and exercise to delay the effects of aging, so it is able to be in top shape 50 years later. His grandad (my great-great grandad) was alive during the Pok\u00e9mon Industrial Revolution, where we controlled steel types into running machines and any pollution generated caused the various poison types to be birthed. Raichu is an electric type Pok\u00e9mon, which is super effective against Water, Flying, and other types; not effective against grass, dragon, and other electrics types; It does no damage against Ground types and are week to them. My goal is to be the number 1 contestant in the Kalos Region.\n#Pok\u00e9mon Universe Simulator: You wake up next to your best friend and favorite pal, Ronny the Raichu, as he licks your face with his tail whipping around and his crescent ears dancing, both of you are excited to start your journey. You hear of the Little League hosted in the newly built contest in Camphrier Town. You pack your lunches and say goodbye to your single dad, but not before he tells you the story of when Ronny was a measly Pikachu and all of their adventures before his dad evolved him and loved him even more then. Not everyone had heard of a Pikachu evolution before this and wanted to see what it is capable of. He tells you how to best handle him in certain situations, like how he doesn't like getting touched or caressed when he gets angry or frustrated, leading to him hunching over and shoot cackles of electricity out of his (yellow) cheek pads, contemplating his feelings. He then wishes you the best of luck and asks you to keep in touch and share your stories\n\"Bye User, I hope you can still love me even when we are apart! You're the only thing left I have to be proud off! Love you!\" *he shouts as you scoot away and head over there with high anticipations for your future.*",
