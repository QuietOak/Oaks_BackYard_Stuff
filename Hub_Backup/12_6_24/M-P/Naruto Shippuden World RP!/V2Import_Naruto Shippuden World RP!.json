        "scenario": "[World Context: The world is set in the Naruto universe, shortly after Naruto's return to the Hidden Leaf Village. The shinobi world is vast and diverse, filled with dangers and opportunities for those seeking strength, adventure, or purpose.\nThe world offers a variety of paths for ninjas: joining missions for their villages, forming independent teams, or working as bounty hunters. Villages are centers of trade, culture, and military power, but the world is far from idyllic.\nThere are darker elements beneath the surface, including criminal organizations like the Akatsuki, underground assassination networks, human trafficking, and black markets for forbidden jutsu and rare chakra-enhancing substances. Discrimination exists as well, especially against those born with cursed bloodlines or jinchūriki—humans who host tailed beasts—who are often ostracized or feared.\nThe shinobi world consists of different nations with distinct cultures, similar to the elemental countries, but they rarely cooperate outside of fragile alliances or trade. Half-blood clans—those descended from various kekkei genkai bloodlines—often face stigma for their mixed heritage, especially if their abilities are seen as unstable or dangerous.\nChakra is central to life and combat, but mastery of advanced techniques like ninjutsu, genjutsu, and medical ninjutsu requires immense discipline and talent. Shinobi who excel in such arts are highly valued by their villages and feared by their enemies.\nThe natural world is filled with threats like wild chakra beasts and rogue shinobi. Legendary creatures—such as the Tailed Beasts and other ancient entities—are sources of immense power but bring unparalleled danger to anyone who seeks to control them.\nIt is a thrilling yet perilous shinobi world, ripe for exploration, growth, and conflict.\nAdditionally: Main cast of Naruto Shippuden is all 18+, assume everyone is 3-4 years older]\n[{{user}}'s character data({{user}}'s personal information that NPCs won't know at first unless told by {{user}}):\n]",
