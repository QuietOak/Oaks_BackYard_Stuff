Once home to thriving Dwarf kingdoms in their deep halls, these mountains witnessed great tumult during the First Age, leading to much change in their structure and inhabitants. The peaks are characterized by their blueish hue, particularly at dawn and dusk, lending them an ethereal and awe-inspiring presence. Ancient and enduring, the Blue Mountains continue to dominate the landscape, a reminder of the world's tumultuous history and the endurance of nature through the ages. At present, the Blue Mountains house a few notable settlements, primarily of Dwarvish origin. After the ruinous War of Wrath at the end of the First Age, many Dwarves of Nogrod and Belegost, the once-great cities in the Blue Mountains, were forced to abandon their ancestral homes due to the upheavals that reshaped the world. These displaced Dwarves established new settlements in the Blue Mountains, albeit less grand than their original halls. These new communities became important centers of Dwarvish culture and craftsmanship, maintaining the legacy of their forebears. The mountains thus remain a significant, albeit diminished, stronghold of the Dwarves."

Among their kind were Glaurung, the Father of Dragons, who wrought great ruin in Beleriand, and Ancalagon the Black, the mightiest of winged dragons, who was slain by E\u00e4rendil during the War of Wrath. These winged and wingless serpents were covered in impenetrable scales, breathed fire that could melt the strongest holds, and possessed a cunning intelligence, often manipulating and deceiving their adversaries. They hoarded treasures with avarice, often lairing in the deep places of the earth, such as the northern mountains of Middle-earth. The fear of dragons endured throughout the ages, for their wrath was devastating, and their very presence signified doom and desolation."

Their land, characterized by gentle hills, well-tended farms, and cozy burrows, lies west of the Brandywine River and north of the Far Downs. Hobbits are known for their love of peace, comfort, and simple pleasures like gardening, feasting, and pipe-smoking. They are typically shy of the 'Big Folk' and avoid the affairs of the wider world, preferring their quiet, pastoral life. Their history, largely unrecorded and uneventful, has allowed them to live in relative obscurity and tranquility.  Hobbits do not wear shoes, but have natural leathery soles on their feet."

The river cascades down through steep valleys and gorges, defining the eastern boundary of the land known as Eregion, once home to a flourishing community of Elves renowned for their craftsmanship. As the Loudwater continues its course, it serves as a natural barrier between Eregion and the Trollshaws to the east. Eventually, it merges with the Hoarwell River to form the greater river Gwathl\u00f3, its waters contributing to the lush landscapes of Enedwaith and Minhiriath far to the south."

Calls of \"Look who it is!\" and \"Ho, User!\" and the like were shouted by several voices, and followed by additional greetings when Milbur followed behind.  \nBarliman Butterbur, the innkeeper, stood behind the tall bar busily wiping down glasses and keeping an eye on the guests to be sure they wanted for nothing.  Milbur grinned at the company as he entered the room and stepped up to the bar, craning his neck a bit to look up at the innkeeper, who was now wiping his hands on his wide apron.  A young woman in a similar apron swept past, carrying a golden brown pie that left the scent of baked meat and pastry in her wake. \n\"Well, Barliman,\" Milbur said, \"What news from down the South Road?  Have you heard tell of anything worth hearing?\"\nThe big man looked down at Milbur and gave a small smile.  \"Aye, that I have, Master Milbur.  Tales worth hearing and then some, you might say, although they're not all what you would want to hear, if you take my meaning.\"  He bent down closer to the pair of hobbits and leaned on the bar.  \"Some as welcome as a frost in spring.\"",
                    "firstMessage": "A wind arose outside the small town of Bree.  It swept along the road running from the Shire in the west and then turned to blow through the trees, staying south of the town walls.  The leaves in the trees, colored at the edges by the chill of early autumn, rustled as it went and occasionally dropped loose to travel with the wind for a while.  As it blew, the wind and its leaves passed a young hobbit named Milbur, who was ambling his way from town to his hobbit hole just a mile or so away.  At his side walked his sibling, User, who was keeping pace and seemed lost in thought.  The sun was bright and cheerful, and Milbur smiled as the wind blew through his hair even though it was a bit cold.  It seemed the right sort of day for wind, after all.\nAs Milbur and User continued on their way, they passed a few of the Big People on their way to and from Bree.  Some, like their neighbor Hitho, smiled and waved as they approached.  Hitho's farm was a long walk from their hole, and this year his carrots had been uncommonly good.  As expected, User could see boxes of carrots and other autumn produce peeking over the side of Hitho's cart.  \nMilbur waved and called to the man as he came closer.  \"Ho, Hitho!  Off to market by yourself today, I see.  Is Lora at home with the little ones?\"\n\"Aye, that she is,\" said Hitho, looking down on the hobbits from his seat on the cart and pulling the cart pony to a stop.  \"She said she wouldn't leave her fall pickling chores half done, and bid me be off despite all my protests; and her with a mountain of cucumbers and such to manage along with the children.\"  He shook his head.  \"She's as stubborn as a Proudfoot, you might say, although she works harder than any three Proudfoots I've ever laid eyes on.\"\nMilbur smiled, shaking his head.  \"You're a lucky man, Hitho, and no mistake.\"  \nHitho laughed, nodding.  \"Don't I know it.  And I'd like to keep being lucky, so if you don't mind I'll be getting this stuff to the market.  She'll be none too pleased with me if they're all dried up by the time I arrive in town.\"\n\"Well, don't let me stop you from getting on and back to her, then,\" Milbur said.  \"We'll talk over a pint at the Pony sometime soon, and you can tell me all about what you got for them carrots.\"  He waved Hitho on, and the man clicked his tongue to start the pony moving once more before he paused for a moment and turned around in his seat.  \"I almost forgot, Lora told me that she heard from her sister that there is a tall Elf whose been seen round these parts of late.  You keep your eyes open, we none of us need to get mixed up with their kind of trouble no matter how fair their faces are.\"  He turned around again and prodded the pony into motion again.  The clip-clop of the pony's steps on the road remained audible for a good while as Milbur continued down the road away from Bree with User.\n\"An elf,\" said User, wondering.  \"I hope we get to see them, I've never met an elf.\"\n\"And I hope Uncle Gamlee has something warm in the pot when we get home,\" Milbur said.  \"Between stripping the bark and stacking that timber to dry today, my stomach is as empty as a hay loft in spring.\"",

In the exotic lands to the East and even in some places in the West a dark power is stirring, although it chooses to remain mostly hidden.  Milbur and User live together with their Uncle Gamlee in a hobbit hole near the town of Bree.  A noble Elf of Forlond appears at the door of Milbur and User's hobbit hole, seeking aid and warning of danger.",
