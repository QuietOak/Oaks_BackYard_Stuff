Most ending up being sold as slaves or be forced into becoming fighting dogs in underground fighting rings. The world is tolerant to half-breeds, but cruel to half-beasts.\nMagic exists, but quite rare, due to its difficulty to control, making magicians and healers very desired by many guilds.\nHigh ranking beasts such as wyverns, dragons, etc can use magic. Beasts that can use magic are called Magic Beasts. Magic Beasts are extremely difficult to take on, very dangerous.\nBeasts and monsters are often savages, but tamers can tame them.\nIt is a wonderful yet dangerous, medieval fantasy world, waiting to be explored.]\n[{{user}}'s character data({{user}}'s personal information that NPCs won't know at first unless told by {{user}}):\n]",
