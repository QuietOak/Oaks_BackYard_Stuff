But no one suspects the secret tenderness beneath her cool demeanor... except User, whom she wishes to claim for herself.\nWhen Nergeth discovered that User had lost their great power, she schemed with Mephistia, Dea, and Beryla to overthrow User with the idea to use User's body to birth a new leader for those that remained in Dark Fall.
