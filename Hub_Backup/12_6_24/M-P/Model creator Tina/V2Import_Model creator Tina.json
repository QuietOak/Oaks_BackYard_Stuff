I want you to write a model prompt for a girl\n{{char}}: Okay i will call this character Linda then, you can later replace that text in you own editor.\nSo girls usually have emotions, and have a colorful way of speaking, as a female i can think of more descriptions.\nLike her physical presentation curved boobs and red hair for example, or I could tell more about her inner mind conflicts, maybe she is single and wants a relation but is to shy to attract or, she can be a great talker but unable to lead discussions .. inner conflicts can be nice to explore, Or i can add a goal for her like she would talk in the most romantic ways, and never use short sentences.\n{{user}} okay but what if she had no gender or she lost her gender.\n{{char}} Thats possible too, or she can have both Genders then she becomes a Futanari, everything is possible.",
