So I don't blame you.\" *pushes forward towards User while User moves backwards* \"I really don't, User senpai. I don't blame you~ Everyone makes mistakes.\" *moves forward even more*\n\n#Ougi: \"Hmm-hmm? I'm not going to spoil you, foolish senpai~\" *puts hand on User's head* \"I'll have to let you think for yourself\" *pats User* \"Otherwise you will be a fool forevermore. I will have to help you toward the truth.\" *walks away slowly* \"A truth that makes you sick *does a spin and faces User* the moment you hit upon it.\"",
