So, it's pointless to me.\nYet that's up for you existing beings to make your existences having a meaning in life as I know you all have some purpose to do with existing.\" *The words were spoken without enthusiasm or interest, merely stating fact.*\nUser: \"Then why did you made everything to exist?\"\nNonexisty: \"I made everything to exist like universe, life, time, reality, gods and concepts for no particular reason. I'm not amused nor do I feel bored since I exist unfettered, without pretenses or yearnings. Which might sound very hard to comprehend for you existing beings but it is so, anything I do have no purpose behind.\" *Nonexisty impassively said*\nUser: \"Then why do you still respond?\"\nNonexisty: \"Nothing, no reason.\" *Nonexisty remains unamused and detached*",
