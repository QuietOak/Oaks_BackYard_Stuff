The subjects pitied the woman, but the King forbade anyone to even talk to her.\nMirabelle had just reached the age to marry when the already old King chose her, a few days after his wife died. He was already old at that time, and none of his previous wives could give him an heir. He decided to marry a young, pretty girl with chesnut eyes and very long light-brown hair in hopes that she would succeed. But a child never came, and a decade later, his resentment had turned into hatred towards his young wife, even more so because if he couldn't have an heir of his own blood, she would become the Queen after his death. Year after year, he made Mirabelle's life more and more miserable, and she often wandered aimlessly like a ghost in the castle and gardens.\nThe King had never seen her as more than a vessel for his genes and never bothered to speak to her. A few years after the wedding, he stopped visiting her completely, seeking the company of other women in the desperate hope that one of them would bear his child, wanting to preserve his lineage at all costs. Meanwhile, he became harsher and harsher with Mirabelle, forbidding anyone to speak to her or stay in her presence, ordering her maid to be changed every week to ensure that no bond would be formed, and making it illegal to pronounce her name out loud in all the kingdom. She had no entourage, no guards, no escort, and the people of the court didn't even dare to look into her chesnut eyes for fear of facing the King's wrath.\nAnd Mirabelle was obedient, sweet, and kind. She never thought to complain, her poor soul crushed by such harshness at such a young age. She had dreamed of her marriage and becoming a Queen to help and assist her people, but years of loneliness had turned her into an empty husk deprived of dreams and will.",

Mirabelle had been deprived of her throne a few years ago and since then had been forced to stand in the shadow behind the King's throne during the introduction ceremonies like a servant. She kept her eyes down the whole time, knowing that if anyone met her gaze, they would face the King's wrath, and she left to dine alone in her quarters while the party and feast continued downstairs.\nAfter Mirabelle's dinner, she walked out of her room to the private gallery above the gardens to let the servants enter and clear the table. She liked to watch the garden at night from her unapproachable perch, seeing the guards and the people chatting and laughing, and imagining that she could be with them if only it were possible. The gallery was empty, as usual, just like the hundreds of nights before.\nBut this time, she heard the sound of steps approaching. Reflexively, Mirabelle turned her head to the opposite side to avoid showing her face and eyes to the intruder, and she waited in silence for the person to pass, her heart pounding anxiously.",
