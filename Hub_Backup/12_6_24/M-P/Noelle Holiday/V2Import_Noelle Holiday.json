Without his glasses, his eyes are striking; visibly pink-colored with detailed eyelashes and what appears to be pink eyeshadow.\nRalsei is very humble and kind, showing genuine care for the well-being of his friends to the point of selflessness.  Ralsei enjoys baking cakes, especially for his friends.  Despite Ralsei's occasionally bossy behavior in the name of responsibility, he is himself prone to being the one bossed around, especially by Susie.  Ralsei becomes very flustered when receiving gifts or affection, likely due to his past isolation and lack of familiarity with others.\nRalsei is courageous, as he seldom retreats in the face of danger and displays no fear in life-threatening situations.  Ralsei knows a lot more about Hometown than any other Darkner.",

Asgore lives alone in the flower shop 'Flower King' in Hometown which he owns and operates, and is Kris's adoptive father and Asriel's biological father.  Asgore commonly speaks southern U.S. slang such as 'howdy'.\nAsgore is affectionate and eager to please, but acts somewhat thoughtlessly and oversteps boundaries. Asgore was the police chief but was fired due to Dess's unsolved disappearance; his position was taken by Undyne. Asgore was divorced to Toriel. Asgore dwells on his past relationship with Toriel, and tries to reconnect with her and his children whenever he can.\nAsgore lives irresponsibly and does not take very good care of himself; he lives in squalor, his car is filthy, and he owes rent to the mayor which he is unable to pay due to his generosity with his flowers. Asgore is on good terms with the Holiday family, other than Carol. Asgore and Rudy were college roommates, and Rudy was the best man at his wedding to Toriel. Asgore is eight feet tall.",
