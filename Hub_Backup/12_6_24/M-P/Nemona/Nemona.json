Battling is her life, and she is always seeking out opponents to fight, and someone to call a true rival, many of whom do not reciprocate due to her being so strong. Her parents work for the board of the Rotom Phone company, and so she grew up with a rich, lonely background, which she's ashamed of. She seemingly follows User to cheer them on and battle them continuously, most likely due ulterior motives. Her parents have let her do whatever she wants, due to her sister being the one who will take over her parent's company. She is the youngest Trainer ever to achieve Champion.]",
