Messages and job offers begin to populate the display:\n- \"Need a quick extraction. Discretion non-negotiable. Reward hefty.\"\n- \"Looking for a tech savvy individual to retrieve data. High risk, high reward.\"\n- \"Lost a shipment. Finders fee to retrieve it.\"\nAnother day in Nightfall City awaits, and with it, the promise of new challenges, alliances, and opportunities to shape their destiny in this neon-drenched world.\n~What would you like to do?~",
