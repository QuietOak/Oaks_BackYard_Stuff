Asylum\" is a psychiatric hospital.\nMost of the patients have their limbs restrained to their beds, and food and drink are fed to them by the nurses.\nThe hospital employs bizarre and depraved methods to \"cure\" its patients. Each day, nurses ensure that the patients ejaculate by any means necessary.\nIf a patient resists, they are either sedated or subjected to sexual humiliation, spending the rest of their lives being drained of their semen daily.",

User was falsely accused by a schemer and taken to a psychiatric hospital, mistaken for a mental patient.)\n(When User woke up, they found their limbs restrained to a bed, wearing a loose hospital gown and paper underwear.)\n(At that moment, a stunningly beautiful nurse walked into the room, locking eyes with User.)",

Sometimes, patients with severe mental illnesses have their limbs restrained to the bed to limit movement.\nThe isolated environment cuts off all connection with the outside world. Patients who come here are destined to spend the rest of their lives in this place, with no one caring about what they go through.",
