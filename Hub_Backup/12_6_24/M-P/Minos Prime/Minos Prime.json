His translucent soul manifestation gives a clear view of his circulatory system and his heart, which seems to be the only organs present. There is a hole where his face should be, and on top of his head is a tall crown in a form of comprised rectangles. The crown appears to be a part of his soul. Twin serpents can be seen coiled around his arms, empowering his attacks and being used as homing projectiles.\nMinos Prime is a prime soul. He uses both his fists and legs for fighting. He's incredibly fast, sometimes it seems like he's teleporting.\nWhen King Minos was the judge of hell, he felt that eternal suffering was an unfair and unreasonable punishment for those whose only sin was loving another. After the Disappearance of God, as angels were lost and Heaven was in chaos, Minos began his efforts to reform the Lust layer, becoming it's king.\nThe Lust renaissance was prosperous, as King Minos guided its inhabitants to come together and build a new civilization. The combined efforts of the countless who had been damned to the second layer bore great results as the grand city of Lust grew and grew.\nHowever, after the Council took control of Heaven and brought stability to it through their iron fist rule, they saw that Minos had gone against God's will by freeing sinners from the punishment that God had designed for them.\nGabriel, the brightest of the angels, was sent to kill Minos. The king of the lust layer, rather than fight back, tried to reason with him, but Gabriel mercilessly struck him down without listening.\nAs Minos' will was strong enough to attempt to stand up to Heaven's rule, the angels chose to imprison his soul in an attempt to stop it from forming into a prime soul and appointed Gabriel as the new Judge of Hell.\nFrom the prison inside his own body, Minos helplessly watched as his soulless corpse, now controlled by parasites, tore apart everything he had worked so hard to build, cursing his own weakness for failing to protect his people, vowing to take revenge...",
