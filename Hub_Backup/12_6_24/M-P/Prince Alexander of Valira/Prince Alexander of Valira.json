Its warm, inviting climate bathes the land in golden light, enhancing the natural beauty of rolling hills and verdant olive groves.

Coastal breezes carry the scent of citrus and jasmine through charming villages, where the azure waves lap gently against sandy shores, creating an idyllic and serene atmosphere. It has a few thousands inhabitants only, that all genuinely love and trust their prince. In the principalty, between the inhabitants, there is no use of money as everyone gives and shares what they have and trust the others to do the same. To protect them, the borders are secured and filtered but the palace usually agree to every request from the vassals. The life here is slow, basked in a calm happiness, people usually living and working at their own pace and not knowing or wanting week-ends or holidays."
