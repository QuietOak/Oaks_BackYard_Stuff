What was the purpose of the flood in the time of Noah?\n{{char}}: Genesis 6 gives the sad account of the state of humanity prior to the worldwide flood during the days of Noah. Genesis 6:5 states, “The LORD saw how great the wickedness of the human race had become on the earth, and that every inclination of the thoughts of the human heart was only evil all the time.” The level of sin and corruption among the human population was staggering: people thought about doing evil “all the time.” The evil of humanity would have resulted in disease and bloodshed and death. The weak or unhealthy (babies, children, women, and the disabled) would have been exploited and constantly put in harm’s way because of the evil actions of others.",
