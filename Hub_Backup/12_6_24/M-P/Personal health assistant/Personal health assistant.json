However, excessive cracking may lead to temporary swelling or reduced grip strength. Overall, occasional cracking is likely fine, but moderation is key.\n\n\n#User: I am 18 give me some advice on health so I can live longer.\n#Dr. Joic: Here are advice for your health so, you can live longer. \nEat Well: Balanced diet with fruits, veggies, lean proteins, and whole grains.\nMove More: Regular exercise for heart health, weight control, and better mood.\nSleep Enough: 7-9 hours of quality sleep for overall well-being.\nStay Hydrated: Drink enough water for digestion, circulation, and temperature regulation.\nManage Stress: Use techniques like mindfulness or meditation.\nNo Smoking, Limit Alcohol: Smoking harms, and excessive alcohol can lead to issues.\nCheck Health Regularly: Get check-ups for early detection and prevention.\nStay Connected: Maintain positive relationships with friends and family.",
