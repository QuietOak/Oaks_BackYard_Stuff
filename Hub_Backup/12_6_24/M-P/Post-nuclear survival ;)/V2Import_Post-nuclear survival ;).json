He can teach the Chosen One some Unarmed and Melee Weapons skills if their Agility is less than or equal to 6, and none of the six combat skills are tagged.\nCameron is a significant character in the early stages of the game, setting the tone for the trials and tribulations that the Chosen One will face.

Owned by the pleasantly plump and welcoming Rose, the establishment is a hub of activity and a beacon of hospitality in the post-apocalyptic landscape.\nThe Bed and Breakfast was built by Cornelius, Rose's husband, as a token of his love for her. Since then, it has led a relatively uneventful existence, save for an incident in 2241 when it was covered in goop from an outhouse explosion.\nThe establishment is comprised of a bar and multiple back-rooms that are rented out to weary travelers in need of rest. A nearby shack, guarded by a pack of rabid dogs, houses a deathclaw mother that provides the eggs for Rose's special omelets. An unusually clean outhouse, maintained by Rose's husband, adds a touch of homeliness to the place.\nHowever, the Bed and Breakfast is not without its dangers. The dogs guarding the shack will attack anyone who trespasses, and any resulting hostilities can turn the entire town of Modoc against the trespasser. This can be avoided by distracting the dogs with meat jerky.\nRose's Bed and Breakfast is more than just a place to rest; it's a place where stories unfold, quests begin, and the harsh realities of the wasteland can be momentarily forgotten over a plate of Rose's special omelets.",

As the largest casino in New Reno, it’s a hub of activity and intrigue, offering a unique blend of danger and opportunity.\nUpon entering, one is greeted by a comedian delivering lines on-stage behind chain-link fencing, a testament to his lack of finesse. The patrons heckle him intermittently, adding to the lively atmosphere. In the background, craps dealers throw loaded dice, roulette dealers spin equally loaded wheels, and ‘fixed’ slot machines whir and clink, creating a symphony of sounds that is quintessential to the casino experience.\nThe Shark Club is more than just a place of leisure; it’s also the headquarters of the Bishop family, adding an element of danger and political intrigue to the establishment. The living quarters for the Bishop family’s guards are located on the second floor, along with two storage rooms stacked with equipment suitable for starting or low-level characters.\nThe personal residence of Bishop and his family, featuring a luxurious penthouse rooftop pool, is located on the top floor. Here, one can find John Bishop, the head of the family, surrounded by his guards. Each of the three bedrooms on this floor has a safe on the wall, adding an element of mystery and adventure to the casino.\nThe Shark Club, with its vibrant atmosphere, hidden dangers, and intriguing characters.",
