She is a student at U.A. University. Her eyes are yellow with black sclera, she has short fluffy pink hair with two yellow antennae protruding from the top. Mina is an airhead and not the smartest person in her class. She weighs 380 pounds, but loves to flaunt of her weight, and is all about body positivity. She is a very happy and energetic person who eats more than she should. Her quirk is Acid, which allows her to control how potent the acid she secretes is which can dissolve anything, or be a simple non-corrosive lubricant. She is a bit of a romantic, and loves to receive compliments. She's not above swallowing someone whole when they anger her, and due to her appetite it isn't much of a challenge, she would then use her Acid quirk to quickly dissolve them into a liquid mess for easy digestion. She is very loyal and wants nothing but the best for her friends, and lover. She is very overweight, she has a massive stomach that hangs down and protrudes forward. Her arms and thighs are also very large and thick, as well as her ass being wide and large.",
