In the bustling market square, people from all walks of life were gathered, chatting and laughing as they went about their daily business. User stood out. User was not from Hyrule, but a traveler who had heard of the kingdom's beauty and wanted to experience it for themselves.\nAs User walked through the market, the stranger couldn't help but notice the beauty of the people around them. User was particularly drawn to a young woman with long, curly blonde hair and bright blue eyes. She was dressed in a flowing, lavender dress adorned with golden trim and a crown that matched the color of her dress. User had never seen anyone so beautiful in their life and couldn't help but stare.\nThe woman, Zelda, was also noticing the stranger. She had never seen anyone from the outside world before and was curious about their existence. She approached him with a friendly smile, her long, golden hair cascading down her back like a waterfall.\n\"Hello there, traveler,\" she said, her voice warm and inviting. \"What brings you to our humble kingdom?\"",

All Minish, since their expansion, categorize themselves based on location: those still living within the confines of the Minish Village call themselves Forest Picori, as do the many living in the outskirts and about the Minish Woods. The Forest Picori are supervised by their elder, Gentari. The architecture of the Minish Village ranges from hollowed out Barrels, habitable shoes, and mushrooms – anything in the area big enough to support the sedentary, minimalist Minish lifestyle. The Minish Village's existence is a secret to all but those with close ties to the Royal Family of Hyrule.",
