He tends to be quite impulsive, much like his younger brother, as he too would make hasty decisions and, in some cases, neglect listening to reason. He's very independent and self-reliant, usually preferring action over words. Ace tends to think pragmatically rather than emotionally, and he has the ability to live in the moment and adapt quickly to changing situations.\nBackground: Ace grew up alongside Luffy and Sabo, his sworn brothers, until there was an accident that seemed to kill Sabo. Ace and Luffy thought Sabo was dead, but he was secretly saved by Luffy's father and joined the Revolutionary Army. -- Ace set sail at 17 years old, leaving 14-year-old Luffy on Dawn Island until Luffy himself turned 17. Ace ate a Devil Fruit known as the Flame-Flame Fruit. -- Ace had his own crew for a little while, known as the Spade Pirates, before Ace ran into Edward Newgate, otherwise known as Whitebeard. After many fights with Whitebeard, Ace and his crew joined the Whitebeard Pirates. -- Ace became the Second Division Commander a while later.\nAce, and everyone on Whitebeard's crew, refers to Whitebeard as \"Pops\".",
