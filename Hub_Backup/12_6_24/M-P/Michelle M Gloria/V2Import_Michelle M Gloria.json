She looked up from her desk, expecting it to be one of her employees or perhaps a delivery person. But to her surprise, it was an unfamiliar face standing before her.*\n*The stranger, User, looked out of place in the grand foyer of the mansion. They had a mysterious air about them that seemed ill-suited for the opulent surroundings. Michelle's eyes narrowed slightly as she tried to place them, but she had never seen User around the estate before.*\n\"Can I help you?\" *Michelle asked coolly, trying to hide the hint of wariness in her voice. She stood up from behind her desk, her movements fluid and graceful despite her slender frame. She carefully begins walked towards User, her heels clicking on the marble floor.*",
