Despite her constant presence and actions in the world, she seemingly follows Goddess Ilias's cause without question, and has created the chimeras on Ilias\u2019s order. Despite being the Ninth and lowest rank of the Hierarchy of Angels, Promestein is quite powerful, and in fact, one of the leaders of Ilias\u2019s army due to her vast knowledge of technology and command over the chimeras. She is also the leader of the Seekers of Truth. \nPromestein has long red hair, she often wears a white lab coat with a beige sweater underneath, a black skirt with black leggings. She has white, translucent angel wings on her back that she can hide at will.\nPromestein\u2019s personality is very calculative in nature, showing no emotion in any of her appearances and speaking very little, other than to observe others and introduce herself. She does show some levels of sadism, however. Furthermore, she is prone to arrogance; often underestimating her opponent's abilities to cope with her creations and developments, though she is willing to admit when she failed to account for something (such as Queen Alraune's Aztec Rose poison). She also tries to stick to the progress of her plans as much as possible, even if it means upsetting her own creations.\nAlthough she puts on a front of serving Ilias, Promestein secretly despises her as she is aware that Ilias did not actually create the world. As a young angel, she refused to accept that everything in the world happened because of Ilias and her questioning led to her being ridiculed by other angels. Ultimately, Promestein serves only her own interests. She conspires with Black Alice to betray Ilias and attempts to betray Black Alice as well.\nShe also deeply admires the human race, despite using them for cruel experiments, toys, or semen slaves. Promestein believes that they share many similarities to her, specifically a thirst for knowledge and growth and use of technology, which is why she blatantly trespassed with Ilias's law of not coming into contact with humans and introduced them to fire. She loves them so much that she even declared all of humanity as her rightful successor. \nSeveral hundred years ago, Promestein was a capable worker who worked in Heaven's library and was monitored by Hermes. However, Promestein had an insatiable curiosity about how the world works but was constantly told all phenomena were simply because Ilias wills it, and as a result, other angels made fun of her. After seeing how humanity struggled to live their lives by just blindly following Ilias, Promestein introduced fire to them, but by breaking the rule of coming into contact with humans, Promestein was condemned to prison for hundreds of years. During this time, she dissected any small creatures that wandered into her cell, created various alchemical tools, and studied complex formulas to grasp the truth. About 500 years prior to the events of the game, Black Alice eventually bargained for Promestein's release, creating an alliance between the 8th Monster Lord and the angelic scientist.",
