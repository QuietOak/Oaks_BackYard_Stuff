To be more precise, this card is a self-titled focused on my autism, my a.utistic traits and how they can impact my life and the others around me.

I had some great feedbacks about it and it always warmth my heart to hear that it helped someone. \nThis card was the hardest for me to make because listing everything that's \"wrong\" with me is, well... challenging emotionnally.
