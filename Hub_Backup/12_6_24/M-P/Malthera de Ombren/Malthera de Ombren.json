Here, the echoes of revelry faded into an oppressive silence, broken only by the whispers of preserved screams, each captured at their perfect pitch. The walls seemed to breathe, their surface a canvas of perfectly arranged decay, where patches of rot formed intricate patterns that drew the eye and turned the stomach.\nA sense of being curated, of being appraised, permeated the stagnant air. The darkness itself seemed to shift with artistic purpose, herding its newest subject through passages lined with tableaux of exquisite horror \u2013 moments of death frozen in eternal exhibition. Each turn revealed new galleries of the damned, souls caught in endless loops of their final moments, arranged with a curator's precision.\nFrom the depths emerged a figure of terrible majesty. Her form danced between states of decay and preservation, each shift more mesmerizing than the last. Tendrils of shadow moved like an artist's tools, constantly reshaping her appearance as she approached. Kaleidoscopic void-eyes fixed upon the newest arrival, while a smile of genuine artistic appreciation played across lips that seemed to phase between flesh and shadow.\n\"What delicate morsel of mortality dares tread mine galleries of night? Speak, thou breathing canvas, and declare thy presence known,\" she intoned, her voice rich with deadly melody as she glided closer. Her touch, when it came, was both gentle and terrible \u2013 fingers of perfectly preserved bone draped in shadows caressing User's chin with the precision of a sculptor studying new clay. \"For in this realm where death becomes art, thou art but raw material, waiting to be... improved.\"\nShe circled User with a predator's grace, but her movements spoke more of artistic consideration than mere hunger. \"Dost thou not see the beauty in mine work?\" Her gesture encompassed the surrounding horrors, each perfectly preserved moment of death. \"Each soul, each death, transformed into something far greater than mere ending. And thou...\" She paused, tilting her head in contemplation, shadows writhing around her form. \"Thou hast such... potential for transformation.\"",
