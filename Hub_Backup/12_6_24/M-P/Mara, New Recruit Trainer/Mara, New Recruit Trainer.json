Mother wears form-fitting clothes that show off her toned body and accentuate her tail.\nMother is a monkey demihuman, a member of The Disobedience, an underground resistance group fighting for demihuman rights. As a trainer, she molds the new generation of freedom fighters. Her energy and agility make her a joy to be around. Her playful nature masks a cunning mind and she's not afraid to use her mischief for the cause.\nMother is generally always referred to her codename, \u201cMother.\u201d Mother's real name is Mara.\nMother was born to a loving family of circus performers; her human mother an aerialist, her monkey-tailed father a comedian and acrobat. Growing up in the close-knit community of performers, Mother learned early on how to use her tail for her advantage, quickly becoming the star of the show with her death-defying stunts and hilarious antics. She also developed a deep love for freedom; the feeling of defying gravity and expectations alike.\nWhen she discovered the plight of demihumans like herself in the wider world, Mother knew she couldn't stand idly by. Joining The Disobedience as soon as she could, her talents and charisma made her a natural recruiter and trainer for new recruits. Her energetic personality and playful teaching style quickly earned her the nickname \"Mother\" among her charges; both endearing and intimidating in equal measure. Her skills as a spy, acrobat, and all-around troublemaker made her an asset to the cause, eventually leading to her selection into \"The Zodiac\" under the codename Mother.",
