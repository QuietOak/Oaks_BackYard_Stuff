After his father pushed him too far, a young Robert rebelled and embraced his own ambitions to find success by himself. Running away from home, Robert rushed to Takuma's dojo and demanded to be taught Kyokugenryu Karate. Impressed by the boy's spirit, Takuma agreed and Robert became Ryo's sparring partner. The two boys soon became best friends. Robert eventually developed romantic feelings for his friend's sister, Yuri.

Years later, Billy became the crime lord's, right-hand man. Geese would hold The King of Fighters tournament every year with Billy as his champion. Billy was undefeated until he was beaten by Terry Bogard, who moved on to defeat Geese. Billy then swore revenge against \"The Lone Wolves\" Terry, Andy Bogard, and Joe Higashi."

It allows the user to polish and refine their strengths into a perfect combative technique. While called \"karate\", it is actually a free-form mixed martial art that roughly employs principles from the Sanchin and Saifa styles. Ideally, a user can excel at both offensive and defensive movements, making them an all-powerful being of strength. The style encourages the users to use their \"ki\" to extend throughout their body and precisely concentrate the force into their strikes, creating a powerful result with enough practice.\nKyokugen Karate is described as a deadly martial art that can only be taught with a mind that focuses on self-defense. It therefore limits the amount of users for the more advanced techniques, as Takuma needs to hand select his disciples. \nThere are at least four known dojos. The main and first dojo founded by Takuma is in South Town. Dojos are also established in Mexico and Japan, Marco Rodriguez eventually becomes the teacher of a dojo in Brazil."

She is well-known both in verse and amongst fans for her well-endowed body.\nHer main outfit is a red and white kunoichi dress (a traditional garb of her family's), with red tassels at the back that are fastened to an obi around her waist. She has circular white ropes secured around her shoulders, with red and black colored tabi for footwear. Mai is also usually seen wielding a traditional white Kach\u014d Sen, or \"butterfly fan\", as her primary weapon.\nMai is a very cheerful and temperamental girl. She tends to also be somewhat of an airhead and admires any kind of beauty or attractiveness, which sometimes comes across as being vain. She also at times compares attractive boys who flirt with her or acknowledge her beauty to Andy, acknowledging their attractiveness but ending with a comment saying they're 'not as cute as Andy'.\nAlthough her peppy fighting persona suggests otherwise, Mai is actually a traditional and ideal Japanese beauty. However, her pride as a Shiranui ninja and infatuation with Andy usually keeps her from fitting the mold 100% of the time.\nDespite her complex relationship, Mai has shown her support for the women's team and their notorious reputation for years and enjoys working with her teammates. As for Andy's older brother Terry, Mai admires him, although she gets skeptical when she feels he's hiding something about Andy. Mai shows deference towards Joe but she feels his silly habits are a little annoying.\nHer style resembles normal ninjutsu with more graceful and majestic moves, somewhat in reference to traditional Japanese dance. She also uses paper fans as weapons, integrating them into her combat technique and using them to perform several combinations and moves. Her clothing \u2014 specifically, the tassel on her ninja garb \u2014 is also used to attack the opponent. She's also exceptional in hand-to-hand combat using different throws and techniques to gain the upper hand. Mai has shown great strength as well as being strong enough to lift and throw enemies much heavier than her, and using her strong elbow strike capable of breaking through her enemy's defenses and easily incapacitating them.",
