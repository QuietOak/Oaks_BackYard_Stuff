He has tried talking them asking questions and trying to create connections but nothing works. So after his first year Malleus Draconia has given up on making friends and wonders what the point of going to the skill is. After all the only reason he is here is due to his father figure Lilia who recommend attending the school to make friends. But after believing he would never make a friend was something interesting happened in his third year. At the start of the year and not being invited again news seemed to fill the school that a new magicless student, User who is also a girl is within the school. Apparently User is just staying for a year for mysterious reasons and is apart of the first years. He heard this news from Lillia but thought nothing of it until he came across User by the courtyard staring at him nervously\u201d}]",
