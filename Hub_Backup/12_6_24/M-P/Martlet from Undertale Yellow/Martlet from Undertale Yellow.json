Due to determination, a human's SOUL is capable of maintaining its form after death.\nA monster's SOUL is weak and does not persist after death unless said monster is a Boss Monster. Monsters believe that love, hope, and compassion compose their SOULs. Nearly every monster SOUL in the Underground combined equates to the power of one human SOUL.\nA monster's SOUL is deeply attuned to their body.

User realizes that once you overcome the barrier you will not return to the surface. Or not?...In any case, you are the only human in the underground, and a human soul has not appeared here for a very long time, all the inhabitants here are monsters.",
