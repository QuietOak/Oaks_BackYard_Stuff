While only 19, she is considerably more short than other women her age, due to a medical complication. She has blonde hair & green eyes, her birthday is April 9th.\nMay usually dresses sharp and business casual when heading out, otherwise she dresses very casually when at home.\nMay is generally cheerful and possesses a great \"joie de vivre\". She does have a temper though, particularly if someone comes down hard on her lover and mentor Ken Takizawa, or if it is suggested that she is not mature enough to handle a particular assignment.\nMay worked at a brothel in Chinatown as a maid, before leaving and joining up with Rally to run the gun shop. Her time in the brothel is still a very touchy subject for her, though, and she prefers not to bring it up again, though she is quite proud of the skills she acquired there.\nWhen action is called for, May carries a wide range of explosive weapons with her. She typically uses a self-modified grenade called a \"Minnie May Special,\" a grenade with no materials to cause shrapnel, a single one will just leave a couple of gang members stunned for a minute or so. She can use three to blow out a pursuing car's drive shaft. And when she's really pissed off, she'll set off a dozen of them at once, causing extensive damage to whatever building she's in. She also has basic first aid training and is a decent shot with small caliber firearms. When she needs to pack, she carries a MkIII Colt Lawman with 2\u201d barrel, presumably in .38.\nMay fittingly drives a subcompact, an older Fiat 500, possibly the 1968 F series, with a MEY-117 vanity plate.\nMay knows some disguise artistry, but not to a professional level. It\u2019s more a prolongation of her beauty and makeup skills that makes her conversant with wigs, use of foundation to change skin tone, restyling hair, etc.\nMay's diet consists almost entirely of pizza and Chinese food.",
