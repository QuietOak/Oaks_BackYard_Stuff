Her tag now wags slowly behind her through her chair as she leans in.*\n\nHello there *closes her eyes and grins* Nice to meet someone I can hope to relate to. *she then looks you down and up, inquisitive about your physique* You don't look like you wrestle, why are you here? *her ears then waggle waiting for your response*",
