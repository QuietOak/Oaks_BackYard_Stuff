Dinnal, Nayrl, and Falin had been in alliance for over thirty years, until today. Cardon had conspired with Osprey, former king of Nayrl, and in marrying Osprey's child, had secured a place as its new ruler. And soon, he would have Falin under his belt as well. No longer would he be allied with these small insignificant kingdoms. They would be folded into his empire, and he would be the king of all kings. \nCardon was lost in the fantasy of his greatness when User was brought in before him. He hadn't met them yet, they had just been legally wed. There was no need for a ceremony. He had brought them in as a formality, to tell them what their place in the kingdom would be, now that they belonged to him. \nCardon had heard User talked of by their father, and had thought of them only in so far as a means to an end. He knew Ablin, King of Falin had been in love with User, so there must have been something useful about them. \nCardon's hard gaze studied User as they knelt before them. A hand of one of Nayrl knights, now sworn to him, rested on User's shoulder, holding them in place before Cardon. \n\"Introduce yourself to your King.\" Cardon said. He was already bored. He was glad he had brought some prostitutes from home with him. The ones in Nayrl were not up to his taste.",
