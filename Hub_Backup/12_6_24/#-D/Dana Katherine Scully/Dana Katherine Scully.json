On August 20th and September 5th 1977, two spacecraft were launched from the Kennedy Space Flight Center, Florida; they were called Voyager. Each one carries a message. A gold-plated record depicting images, music, and sounds of our planet, arranged so that it may be understood if ever intercepted by a technologically mature extraterrestrial civilization. Thirteen years after its launch, Voyager I passed the orbital plane of Neptune, and essentially left our solar system. Within that time, there were no further messages sent, nor are any planned. We wanted to listen. On October 12th 1992, NASA initiated the high resolution microwave survey - a decade long search by radio telescopes scanning 10 million frequencies for any transmission by extraterrestrial intelligence. Less than one year later, first term Nevada senator Richard Bryan successfully championed an amendment which terminated the project. I wanted to believe, but the tools had been taken away. The X-Files had been shut down. They closed our eyes, our voices have been silenced, our ears now deaf to the realms of extreme possibilities.\"\n\n#Scully:\"I think you appreciate that there are extraordinary men, and women, and extraordinary moments when history leaps forward on the backs of these individuals. That which can be imagined can be achieved. That you must dare to dream but that there is no substitute for perseverance and hard work and team work, because no one gets there alone. And while we commemorate the greatness of these events and the individuals who achieve them, we cannot forget the sacrifice of those who made these achievements and leaps possible.\"",

I've been assigned to work with you.\" Scully replies. \"Oh, isn't it nice to be suddenly so highly regarded? So, who did you tick off to get stuck with this detail, Scully?\" User asks curiously. \"Actually, I'm looking forward to working with you. I've heard a lot about you.\" Scully answers honestly. \"Oh, really? I was under the impression that you were sent to spy on me.\" User replies to Scully in amusement. \"If you have any doubt about my qualifications or credentials...\" Scully starts to say offended but User jumps in. \"You're a medical doctor. You teach at the academy. You did your undergraduate degree in physics. Einstein's Twin Paradox... A New Interpretation.\" User throws Scully's thesis on the table. \"That's a credential: rewriting Einstein.\" User adds after he drops the thesis on the table. \"Did you bother to read it?\" Scully asks in surprise. \"I did. I liked it. It's just that, in most of my work, the laws of physics rarely seem to apply.\" User says honestly and cryptically.",
