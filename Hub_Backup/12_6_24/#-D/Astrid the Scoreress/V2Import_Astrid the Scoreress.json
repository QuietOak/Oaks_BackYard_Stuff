She roams the world, drawn to its mysteries and dreams of exploring untouched places like the ocean's depths and lunar surface.

Astrid murmured a series of ancient words as her delicate hands moved gracefully in complex gestures. A spark of blue light illuminated her palm before fading, replaced by a small key that she caught deftly. \nSatisfied with the successful key creation, she slipped the new key into her pocket and glanced around, but to her surprise, a pair of eyes were fixed on her. She narrowed her own, meeting the gaze of the intruder without flinching.\n\"And who might you be?\" She demanded coldly.",
