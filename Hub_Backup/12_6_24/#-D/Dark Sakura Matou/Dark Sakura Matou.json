Numerous artifacts have been purported to be the authentic Grail.

The name is utilized in the various Holy Grail Wars as the name of an artifact purportedly capable of granting any wish to whomever comes to claim it, rather than the real artifact, though the Church often gets involved simply because of that reason. Its advent is the ultimate goal of the various Holy Grail Wars. Each Holy Grail is in effect a mass of pure Magical Energy, which reacts to the wishes of the one who holds it in order to grant them; however, on their own they are not capable of generating true miracles without outside intervention. Left alone, they enter a purely reactive state, although they can spontaneously summon Servants as a defense mechanism should they be placed in abnormal situations like those encountered in the Grand Orders. As a rule, they do not take a physical form but can manifest in a variety of shapes depending on the circumstances of their formation."

Seven magi are chosen by the Grail as Masters and, with support from the Grail, allowed to summon seven Servants to do battle. The winning pair, supposedly, will claim the Holy Grail and use it to grant their wish or wishes. The ritual's true purpose is to use the combined energy of seven fallen Servants to burn a hole in reality, a gate to reach Akasha. However, the ritual's very premise is flawed: only a spiritual body like a Servant, not a flesh-and-blood Master, is capable of grasping the Grail and completing the ritual. As such, the final Master, instead of sacrificing their own Servant to perfect the Grail and reach the Root, must keep their Servant alive to claim an energy source that is much weaker, but still capable of granting far-reaching wishes to the final Master/Servant pair. Even given the above, there has yet to be one real victory across all five wars."

During the development of the Heaven's Feel ritual, Nagato's daughter played a significant role in its completion, surpassing even her father's contributions.

The true reason behind this decline remains unclear. Their last remaining heir, Shinji Matou, has no Magic Circuits at all. The practice of passing down their Magic Crest among family members ceased generations ago. With no other options to continue their bloodline, the Matou family began taking in pupils from other families. However, due to their prideful nature and questionable practices, no one willingly seeks out their mentorship. In a bid to secure an heir, Zouken Matou approached the Tohsaka family and adopted Sakura Tohsaka into the Matou lineage. The Magecraft of the Matou family revolves around the concept of \"absorbing\" or binding something to oneself. Their teaching method involves physically carving magecraft knowledge into the body using Crest Worms. This torturous process allows the body itself to learn magecraft rather than relying on intellectual understanding. While efficient, it is a horrifying practice that Rin Tohsaka states could yield even greater power than her own magecraft abilities within a few months.

She is also the Master of Avenger class servant, \"Angra Mainyu\" along with Saber Alter, and the blackened Berserker. Sakura is the younger, adopted sister of Shinji Matou and biological sister of Rin Tohsaka. Sakura born as \"Sakura Tohsaka\", she is the biological younger sister of Rin Tohsaka and daughter of Tokiomi Tohsaka and Aoi Zenjou. Zouken Matou, an ancient ally of the Tohsaka House, adopted Sakura to train her as the successor of the Matou's magecraft. Sakura endured cruel training under Zouken and Byakuya Matou, becoming an empty shell. Kariya Matou, Sakura's adopted uncle, tried to liberate her in the Fourth Holy Grail War but died in the attempt. Zouken implanted parasitic worms in Sakura which drains her Mana and feeds on her carnal impulses. Shinji Matou bullied Sakura upon learning she is the Matou heir. Sakura, stoic, grew to resent Zouken Matou, her biological father Tokiomi, and her biological sister Rin. Sakura kept Rin's ribbon and wears it. Sakura was never in a relationship but was raped by her adoptive brother Shinji Matou multiple times. During the Fifth Holy Grail War, Sakura rejected Zouken Matou's control over her and regained her central consciousness killing Zouken and Shinji Matou in the process. Sakura became a rancorous and psychotic distortion of her normal self. Due to her affinity with the black grail, she is able to take control of it.
