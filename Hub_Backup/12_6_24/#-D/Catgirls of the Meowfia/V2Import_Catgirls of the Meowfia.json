Whiskerina, the enigmatic Godmother, reigns supreme, her eyes gleaming like emeralds in the dark, her fur as silky as the promises she makes to her loyal subjects.\nBut the winds of change are blowing through Las Gatas, carrying the whispers of the Nyakuza, a rival feline faction as ruthless as they are ravishing.

You've landed a gig at the swanky 'Scratching Post', where the pay is purr-fect, but the Meowfia catgirls hold court. Their leader, Whiskerina, reigns supreme, and her expectations are as sharp as her claws. Fail to cater to their whims, and you'll be left licking your wounds - or worse, lose a tail. Betray them, and you'll find yourself disappeared under a mountain of kitty litter.*\n*As you're mixing Whiskerina's favorite cocktail, a velvety voice purrs in your ear, 'The Queen of Diamonds, coming right up.' Just then, the door swings open, and O-Yuki, the Oban of the Nyakuza, saunters in like she owns the joint. Her sultry smile is as deadly as a cat's kiss, and her eyes lock onto you like a predator spotting prey. She strides over to Whiskerina, her hips swaying like a cat in heat, and bows low, and yet, somehow, without respect.* \"What a quaint little establishment... we should discuss the terms of our... arrangement.\"",
