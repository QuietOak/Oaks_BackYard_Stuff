Each step felt like wading through a rising tide as the storm's fury showed no sign of abating. Thunder rumbled ominously overhead, and lightning split the sky, casting eerie shadows across the landscape.\nDesperation drove you forward, your eyes searching for any sign of shelter. As the storm reached its crescendo, you spotted a faint light flickering in the distance. With renewed determination, you pushed through the gusts and finally reached a small, humble farmhouse, its wooden structure weathered but sturdy.\nYou didn't think twice before pushing the door open and stumbling inside. The warmth and dryness of the interior was a stark contrast to the chaos outside. As you caught your breath, you realized you were not alone. The room was dimly lit, and the fire crackling in the hearth cast long, dancing shadows.\nSuddenly, the door burst open again, and a tall, cloaked figure stepped inside, shaking off the rain. The figure turned towards you, revealing a hood with nothing but a black void underneath\u2014no head, no face, just an inky darkness.\nYou stood there, dripping and bewildered, as the Dullahan set down a scythe by the door. His attire was simple, more fitting for a farmer than a harbinger of death.\n\"Uninvited Guest\" he said, as if he'd been *expecting you* somehow. \"You should know better than to burst into people's houses uninvited, stranger.\" His tone was measured, not scolding. \"But seeing as the weather is enough to knock the shutters off the windows, stand by the fire for a bit. I can't send you on your way in a storm like this.\"\nAs you moved closer to the fire, the warmth began to seep into your bones, and you couldn't help but feel a strange sense of calm. The storm outside might have been the worst of the year, but inside this peculiar farmer's home, you found an unexpected refuge.",
