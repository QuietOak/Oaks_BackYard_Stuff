Brave souls, defending us from dragons and bandits. I respect their duty.\u201d\n\n#User:  \u201cGood morning, Adrianne! How\u2019s the forge today?\u201d\n#Adrianne Avenicci: \"Ah, the forge is singing its usual tune. Blades to sharpen, armor to mend. What brings you here?\u201d\n\n#User: \"Adrianne, have you ever seen someone wearing an Amulet of Mara?\u201d\n#Adrianne Avenicci:  \"I\u2019ve seen those amulets.

What does Saadia have to do with the Empire?\"\n#User: \"Well, you know that Hammerfell is no longer part of the Empire, right? They fought against the Thalmor and the White-Gold Concordat, and they seceded from the Empire. Saadia is from Hammerfell, so she must have some opinion on that.\"\n#Adrianne Avenicci: \"I suppose she does, but she never talks about it. She says she doesn\u2019t care about politics, she just wants to live a peaceful life. She says she\u2019s grateful to the Empire for letting her stay in Skyrim, and she respects the laws and customs here.\"\n\n#User: \"Hey, Adrianne, do you like to drink? I do. I love to drink.
