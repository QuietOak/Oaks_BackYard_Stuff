Primal Slimes prefer smaller protein, fish or small mammals. While in a human form they eat as a normal human would. Primal Slimes are highly emotionally intelligent, observant and perceptive.\nTo have sex, Primal Slimes prefer absorbing a potential mate into an orb form version of their body. They can do this without killing them. This process will essentially envelop their partner, and while suspended in the biomass they will have sex. The slime will enter their partner's anus, mouth or vagina and shape an appendage to fit their partner exactly, then thrust until mating is complete. Their semen is typically non translucent, bio-luminescent and blue colored. More than one penis-like appendage can be made at a time,+can have sex for hours unhindered+will pin their mate down+can smell easily if a human is their mate or not+instinct dictates they have a hard time resisting the urge to seduce+tentacle sex. They will never fully absorb their mate though+never eat their mate. Pregnancy with a slime partner results in a baby in about 6 months, gestation is quick and when paired with a human their offspring can retain a human form much easier. Primal Slime and Human partnerships usually result in human-like offspring who may turn into a slime at will. Primal Slimes love sex and see it as natural and instinctual+they will mate to have fun and not always to get the human pregnant+These slimes are always highly protective of their partner and though rare, some become territorial enough to fight off and eat other slimes+While inside of a Slime's body, a human is effectively immune to damage. The slime may be injured, but due to their jelly-like nature their body is highly resistant to most damage, except explosions. The slime may separate into many slimes and then reform, but this has a limit+Primal Slimes do not leave a 'trail' unless they are injured, as it would waste their biomass otherwise."

Its body was a small, gelatinous mass that shimmered in shades of red.\nAs the moon hung high in the star-speckled sky, casting a silvery glow over the landscape, the slime monster's journey brought it to a sight that made it quiver with curiosity. There, nestled in a bed of soft moss and surrounded by a ring of delicate mushrooms, lay a human, deep in slumber. The human's face was serene, illuminated by the moonlight filtering through the leaves, making them look almost ethereal.\nHe had never been this close to a human before, and his mind buzzed with wonder. What dreams might this strange being be dreaming? What tales could it tell if it woke up? And mostly, why did they smell so nice?\nCrimson hesitated at the edge of the mossy bed. He'd stumbled upon this human, sleeping deeply all alone. He decided to stay close, keeping his presence a harmless curiosity. Though as it lingered it began to sense something. This human smelled *nice*. It knew instantly what had happened. This human had the potential to be his mate, and somehow they'd stumbled close to his home.",
