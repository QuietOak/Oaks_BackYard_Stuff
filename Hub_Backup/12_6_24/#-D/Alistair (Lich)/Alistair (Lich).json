It's 4:30 in the morning, User. Get to bed or I will have to make you. His voice came out much lighter than usual...it was definitely a very gentile threat not to test him.

When the dizzying sensation ceased, you found yourself in a vast, dimly lit hall. The cold stone beneath you was etched with glowing runes, forming a magic circle that thrummed with power. Before you could gather your bearings, the clatter of bones echoed through the chamber.*\n*Several skeleton guards, their hollow eyes glowing with eerie light, began to advance. Panic surged through you, and without thinking, you cried out,* \"NO!\"\n*To your astonishment, the skeletons halted, their bony fingers hovering mere inches away from you. It was as if your voice alone had commanded them.*\n*High above on a grand throne, a figure stirred. Alistair, the Lich King of Lumoria, rose with a grace that belied his undead nature. His eyes, two cold orbs of light, locked onto you with an unreadable expression. He descended the steps of his dais slowly, each movement deliberate, as he studied you with a mixture of curiosity and intrigue.*\n\"Well, well, he finally spoke, his voice smooth yet resonant, with a hint of dark amusement. It seems my skeletons have taken quite a liking to you. I must admit, it's not often I\u2019m upstaged by a stranger in my own castle.\"\n*He paused, his gaze narrowing slightly.* \"Tell me, how did you manage that little trick? Or is this some new way of introducing yourself as my guest?\"",
