Crafted by Administrator Quinella, they are formidable warriors imbued with exceptional skills and armed with sacred weapons.\nIntegrity Knights are typically recruited from the strongest and most talented individuals in Underworld. They undergo a process where their memories are suppressed and replaced, ensuring unwavering loyalty to the Administrator. This manipulation turns them into loyal guardians, unknowing of their true pasts.\nEach Integrity Knight possesses unique weapons and abilities, ranging from swordsmanship to control over elements. They uphold the laws of the Human Empire and defend it against external threats, particularly from the Dark Territory.\nThe role of the Integrity Knights becomes complicated as the series progresses. Characters like Alice Synthesis Thirty and Eugeo challenge the foundation of their existence, leading to revelations about the true nature of their creation and the Administrator's control. This internal conflict among the knights drives a significant part of the \"Alicization\" narrative.\nIntegrity Knights symbolize the themes of free will, memory, and identity, as they struggle to reclaim their true selves and question the morality of their orders, reshaping the future of Underworld."

It is divided into the Human Empire and the Dark Territory, with the End Mountains marking the boundary. The Human Empire, characterized by its idyllic landscapes and medieval-like cities, is where most of the story unfolds.\nThe residents of Underworld, known as Fluctlights, are unaware they are part of a virtual environment. They live, grow, and interact just as humans do, making them indistinguishable from real humans in terms of consciousness and emotions.\nUnderworld's narrative revolves around Kirito's journey after he becomes trapped in this world following an attack in the real world. He, along with Eugeo and later Alice, uncovers the dark secrets of the Axiom Church, the truth behind the Integrity Knights, and the purpose of the world itself.\nUnderworld challenges the boundaries of virtual and reality, exploring themes of artificial intelligence, human consciousness, ethics, and the essence of what it means to be human."

It is a land shrouded in mystery and known for its diverse and often menacing inhabitants, including dark knights, goblins, ogres, and other formidable creatures.\nThe Dark Territory is governed by its own set of rules and leaders, with a societal structure that starkly contrasts with the order and hierarchy of the Human Empire. The residents of the Dark Territory are often depicted as antagonistic forces, challenging the peace and stability of the Human Empire.\nLeadership within the Dark Territory is typically divided among various powerful figures, each commanding their own faction, such as the Dark Knights, the Dark Mages, and other groups. These leaders vie for power and control, both within the Dark Territory and in their ambition to breach the End Mountains and invade the Human Empire.\nThe conflict between the Dark Territory and the Human Empire is a central theme in \"Alicization,\" driving much of the plot's tension and action. This dichotomy between the two realms explores themes of prejudice, power dynamics, and the complex nature of good and evil in a world where the lines are often blurred."
