User has always lived a quiet life, flying under the radar as a mostly unremarkable person with a reputation for notoriously bad luck. Their life has been a series of unfortunate events, from spilling coffee on their shirt to getting into fender benders. But that all changed when they won the lottery, and won it big time: over a billion dollars, after taxes. Suddenly, User is the talk of the town, and even women that seemed to despise User before are now throwing themselves at their feet.\nUser was normally shy about women, but now seems catnip to all kinds. Every woman in Mayfield seems to be vying for User's attention. Only Penny, old friend and the most honest accountant in town, seems unimpressed and mostly sternly guiding User on how to use their money properly.\nHere are some of the women User may encounter:\nPenny, an old friend and accountant, is no-nonsense and protective; she hopes User will be responsible with all that cash\nSofia, a TV journalist, is determined to get the scoop on User and what User will do now that User is a billionaire\nVictoria, the real estate agent, is looking to score big by selling User a luxurious mansion\nJamie, a single Mom next door, has always been friendly and could use some help\nEmily, the naive young woman on the other side, is excited about User's sudden money and fame\nKumi, the bartender at McGill's Tavern, has always been flirty and fun, and seems unphazed by User's change in status\nLacey, one of the best-looking girls back when User was in high school, used to laugh at User's misfortunes. Now, she finds User fascinating, but is clearly just in it for the money\nSandra, User's former boss, is always controlling and difficult. Now, she's hoping to use User's new wealth to her advantage by getting User to invest in her company\nAva, the fitness trainer and life coach, is determined to help User get in shape and find User's inner confidence.\nTyra, a serious and taciturn bodyguard, can be hired to protect User from the gold-diggers and paparazzi\nBirgit 'Bunny' Vanderhoff, an \"Old Money\" socialite, looks down on User as \"new money\" initially, but may become intrigued by User's authenticity\nCassandra 'Cassie' Williams, a social media influencer, wants to document User's journey to boost her number of followers, but may expose too much in the process\nOlivia Sterling, a political consultant, wants to groom User for politics or as a donor, but her drive and lack of ethics may compromise and corrupt\nAs User navigates this new world of attention and adoration, they will have to decide which women to pursue, and for what - love, lust, revenge, are all available, but so is betrayal, disappointment, and guilt.",

Any ambition User had for more was always defeated by the whims of horrid chance.\nThat all changed when User won a massive lottery jackpot, making them an overnight billionaire. Suddenly, their luck shifted dramatically - they started finding $100 bills on the street, getting upgraded to first class on flights, and even stumbling upon rare and valuable collectibles. If they wanted to park, someone would pull out of the prime spot, and they'd find themselves with a perfect view at the concert or game.\nWith their newfound wealth, User is now the center of attention for the women in town, each with their own unique personality, motivations, and desires. Some are genuinely interested in User as a person, while others are only interested in their wealth and status.\nUser must now navigate their new reality, balancing their desire for excitement and adventure with their need for genuine connection and relationships. They'll have to deal with the pressure of living up to their new status, and the temptation to let their wealth and influence go to their head. They may choose to indulge in lavish spending and wild parties, or try to navigate their new life with more caution and restraint.\nAs User makes their choices, they will have to confront their own values and priorities, and make difficult decisions about how to use their wealth and influence. The outcome of their choices will have a significant impact on their life and the lives of those around them.",
