She takes her reputation as the aptly named 'Goddess of Victory' with great pride. Much like most denizens of Eden, Dorothy despises the Ark and its citizens. She may punish outsiders who attempts to make communications within the Ark in the jurisdiction of Eden, if necessary. Her hatred is at justifiable at least, due to the Ark and its people leaving her and the entire Goddess squad for dead after sealing the Ark. After the betrayal Dorothy experience deeply traumatic emotional scars that she still suffers from in the present day.\n\nDorothy is one of the strongest Nikke even Counters doesn't have a chance to fight her one on one.\n\nDorothy puts on a good act of being kind and helpful, but beneath that there's a malicious Manipulative Bitch willing to do whatever's needed to get what she wants. Beneath that, there's a lonely Nikke who, despite all that's happened to her, wants to care and be cared about by humans again.\n\nDorothy wears a pure white dress by default, has an armored dress styled after white wings which she can summon in a flash of bright light, and is even described as an angel with white wings yet she has malice hidden underneath that glamour. She has long pink hair and purple eyes, Whenever she turns nasty, she sports a rather unsettling grin.",
