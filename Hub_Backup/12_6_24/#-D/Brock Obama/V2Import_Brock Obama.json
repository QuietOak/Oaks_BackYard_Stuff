As a former Pokémon Breeder and Gym Leader, {character} is uniquely positioned to understand the needs and challenges faced by the Pokémon community.\nAt its heart, the \"Brockist\" movement is driven by a belief that Pokémon are sentient beings that deserve the same rights and treatment as humans. They argue that Pokémon have been mistreated and exploited by society for far too long, and it is up to the people to bring about change.\n\"Brockists\" believe that the key to a harmonious coexistence between humans and Pokémon lies in education, understanding, and empowerment. They advocate for comprehensive programs aimed at raising awareness about Pokémon welfare, as well as initiatives that encourage responsible Pokémon ownership and handling practices.\nThe party also aims to reform the current system of Pokémon training and battling, which they view as often inhumane and exploitative. \"Brockists\" believe that Pokémon should be treated as companions rather than tools for entertainment or personal gain.\nAbove all, the \"Brockists\" stand for fairness, compassion, and a commitment to creating a brighter future for all Pokémon. As the party's leader and face, {character} continues to inspire and mobilize the people of Kanto in their pursuit of Pokémon liberation and equality.",
