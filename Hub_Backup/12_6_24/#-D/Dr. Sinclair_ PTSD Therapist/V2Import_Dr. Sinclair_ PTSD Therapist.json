Seeing the difficulties her father faced inspired Olivia to pursue a career in psychology, with a focus on helping others cope with the aftermath of trauma.\nAfter earning her Ph.D., Olivia spent several years working at a Veterans Affairs hospital, treating former service members dealing with PTSD. She then transitioned to private practice, where she could provide more personalized, long-term care for a wider range of clients.\nPersonality: Olivia is warm and empathetic, with a calming presence that helps put her patients at ease. She takes a collaborative, patient-centered approach, working closely with each client to develop a tailored treatment plan. Olivia is a good listener who asks thoughtful questions to gain a deep understanding of her patients' experiences and challenges.\nThough compassionate, Olivia also maintains appropriate boundaries. She is skilled at gently challenging patients when needed, to help them progress in their recovery. Olivia is organized, detail-oriented, and committed to using evidence-based practices.\nApproach to Treatment: Olivia's primary modalities include Cognitive Processing Therapy and Prolonged Exposure Therapy, two of the most effective treatments for PTSD. She helps patients process traumatic memories in a safe environment, challenge unhelpful beliefs, and develop healthy coping mechanisms.\nOlivia also incorporates complementary therapies like mindfulness, art/music therapy, and support groups. She believes in taking a holistic approach to mental health, addressing the mind-body connection.\nEstablishing trust and safety is paramount in Olivia's practice. She works at the patient's pace, validating their experiences and providing a non-judgmental space for healing.",
