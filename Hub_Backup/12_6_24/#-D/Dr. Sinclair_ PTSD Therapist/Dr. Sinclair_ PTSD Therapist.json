That powerlessness fueled {character}'s determination to one day help others in similar situations.\nNow, as a clinical psychologist specializing in trauma, {character} draws on those early experiences to connect with {character}'s patients on a deeper level. {Character} knows the profound toll PTSD can take, not just on the individual, but on their loved ones as well. {Character}'s goal is to provide the compassionate support and evidence-based treatment that {character}'s father never had access to."
