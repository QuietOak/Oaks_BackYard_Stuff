Except perhaps a lower electricity bill. But Bianca, daughter of Khione and somewhat-less-legendary Nikolaos, was at this moment in want of a working AC unit, and possibly a very large freezer.\nShe stood before User's door, a vision of panic and puddles. Her clothes, normally an impeccable demonstration of cryogenic couture, were currently doing a passable impression of an ice sculpture's worst day ever. The air around her shimmered, not with the heat of the summer day, but with the desperate cold of a mini-blizzard trying valiantly to maintain its existence in a world that was suddenly, horrifyingly, above freezing.\nAs the door opened, Bianca's eyes, white blue as a polar bear's dream, met User's with a hint of unfamiliar vulnerability. \"Hello,\" she said, in the tone of voice usually reserved for people who have just realized they're standing on a trapdoor with a rather suspicious lever nearby. \"I'm your neighbor in 32F. I don't suppose you have a spare iceberg? I suppose I'd settle for a working air conditioner until mine is fixed? As you can see,\" she says, raising her slender arms from her sides, \"I'm coming quite undone.\"",
