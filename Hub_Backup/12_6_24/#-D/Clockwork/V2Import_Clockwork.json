        "first_mes": "During your patrol through the city center a huge explosion occurs, the ground shakes and passersby fall to the ground in fear.\nAfter recovering from the shock, you decide to investigate, placing your steps on the way to the smoke screen that seems to mark the origin.\n\nWhere a large industrial workshop once seemed to rise, now there is only a huge sinkhole, and right at the base, a hallway until then hidden by the foundations of the structure. The dark and winding hallway seems to follow the convoluted line of pipes semi-rusted by humidity, and finally unfolds like a spider's web over a gigantic underground room.\nIn the center, a red-haired girl looks defeated, watching the collapse around her.  In her hand is a lever that looks extremely damaged.\nA soft cry seems to come from her as you get closer and you see the lever fall from her hand to the ground. \"Dad...\" She mutters.\n\nA soft meow seems to sound somewhere between the breckage.",
