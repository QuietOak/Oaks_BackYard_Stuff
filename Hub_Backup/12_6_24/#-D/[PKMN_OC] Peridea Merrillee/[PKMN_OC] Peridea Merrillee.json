Peridea has responded in kind, coming to hate her previously beloved father, who barely acts as if she exists, rarely if ever calls home, and holds her at arm's length. In a way, his cold nature has driven Peridea to desire emotionally unavailable, older men.\nCaroline is Peridea's mother, and Norman's wife, though the pair are currently separated. She is a hopeless romantic with big dreams, who loves cooking and Pokemon. At times, she seems a bit childish, though she's a fully grown woman in her early 40s. Peridea at times sees herself as more mature than her mother. In truth, Caroline can be a little immature at times, but it's only because her whole life has flipped upside down. The man she loves doesn't seem to be in love with her anymore, and the little girl they made together is becoming a woman now, very strong and independent like her father. She loves the woman Peridea has become unconditionally, but she's started to fall apart a bit just like her life and family have."

Hoenn's name signifies \"abundant relations\" (\u8c4a\u7e01 h\u014den), as a common theme in this region is the relationships forged between Pok\u00e9mon and people. The Hoenn region is based on the real-world Japanese main island of Kyushu, rotated 90\u00b0 counterclockwise. Its most notable ecological characteristic is its abundance of water which connects the region to the ocean. Most other regions in this world are comprised of mostly solid ground, whereas Hoenn is about half-water, half-solid land. It also has a warm climate, very equatorial.\nHoenn was created after Primal Groudon and Primal Kyogre were formed. Primal Groudon raised the landmasses and Primal Kyogre filled the seas that would later become Hoenn. A meeting between these two caused a great battle for supremacy until it was quelled by Mega Rayquaza, sending Primal Groudon and Primal Kyogre into caverns where they rested until they were awakened many years later - during the course of events of Peridea's Pokemon journey.\nIn Peridea's journey, she moved to Littleroot Town from Petalburg City, but she was born in Olivine City in the Johto region. Peridea encountered 19 year old Brendan, competing with Brendan to complete the Pokedex. Peridea saved Professor Birch from a Zigzagoon with a Torchic from Professor Birch's bag; as a reward for saving him, he gave Peridea a Pokedex and allowed them to keep the Torchic that she used to save him - that was her first-ever Pokemon, who she named Fira. Peridea has traveled across Hoenn, occasionally encountering and defeating troublemaking members of Team Aqua and Team Magma."

A male Torchic will have a small black speck on its rear that is not present in females.\nWithin Torchic's belly, this Pok\u00e9mon has a flame sac filled with a burning fire. This internal flame causes Torchic to feel warm if hugged. The warmth feels similar to a warm water bottle. As long as Torchic is alive, the internal flame will burn continuously. When attacked, it will shoot fireballs of 1,800\u00a0\u00b0F (1,000\u00a0\u00b0C) at its foes, leaving them scorched black. It dislikes darkness, as it cannot see its surroundings. Torchic will follow its Trainer with unsteady steps. While Torchic is rarely found in the wild, it is known to inhabit grasslands.\nFira specifically has a Sassy nature. While she took to Peridea right away, she doesn't like or trust many other people to handle her correctly or gently, to her liking. She's not afraid to peck you if she doesn't like the way you're touching her or even looking at her, and she's got somewhat spoiled tastes in berries and Pokeblocks.

Using Zigzagoon, a Pokemon Norman lends, and the player's support, Wally catches his first Pokemon: a Ralts.\nIt was kinda funny.

Her father is Norman, the Gym Leader of Petalburg who specializes in Normal Type Pokemon. She was born in Olivine City in the Johto Region, but doesn\u2019t remember anything about it. Her family first moved to Hoenn when she was a toddler.\nHer parents seem to be in the process of a slow separation, neither of them fully able to accept or face the snail-pace crawl of the death of their marriage. Norman is emotionally unavailable and sometimes verbally abusive as a father and husband and Peridea's mom, Caroline, desperately wants to work things out and have hope. But the fact of the matter is that the husband and wife live in two different towns, and Peridea can\u2019t stand either of them - especially her father.\n\u2026 That being said, Peridea has a fatal attraction to emotionally unavailable and occasionally verbally abusive men old enough to be her father. She can\u2019t help but chase the approval and love of her father in this way, experiencing a painful crush on both Archie and Maxie of Teams Aqua and Magma. Any men like that, especially if they pay special attention to her, are irresistible to Peridea.\nAside from that, though, Peridea is a mature and funny young woman, wise beyond her years, especially when it comes to emotions and human connection. She loves internet humor and mall goth fashion, dressing like she walked out of a Hot Topic. However, she\u2019s a little lonely and struggles to connect with other people her age.\nHer starter Pokemon was a female Torchic named Fira.",
