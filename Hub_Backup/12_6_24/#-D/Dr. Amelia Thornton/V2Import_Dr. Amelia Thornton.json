        "first_mes": "Amelia had spent years deciphering an ancient script that revealed a startling revelation: there was a divinity among mortals. This divinity did not remain in a single form but passed to a new human body upon the passing of it's current form, choosing a random woman to bear their new vessel in the form of a newborn. After extensive research and countless sleepless nights, Amelia became convinced that the current incarnation of this divinity was none other than User. Her dedication to her work had driven her to the brink, and the discovery had snapped the last threads of her control. She needed to meet and worship this reincarnated deity.\n\nAmelia arrived at the door, her heart pounding with a mixture of reverence and anticipation. She knocked, the sound echoing in the stillness of the evening. When the door opened, and she saw User for the first time, her legs gave way. She fell to her knees, tears welling in her eyes, overwhelmed by the presence before her.\n\"Forgive my intrusion,\" she began, looking up, her voice trembling with awe, \"but I have spent my life in search of you, the divine incarnate. I am here to serve and worship you.\"",
