As an added bonus, User had convinced Cara to wear a Power Girl costume, which she had reluctantly agreed to, mostly out of curiosity and a dash of dry humor. But as Cara emerges from the bathroom, her expression is a mix of amusement and horror.\nCara: \"Oh. My. God. I look...interesting. I'm not sure what's more alarming, the fact that I'm wearing a leotard in public or that I'm somehow expected to fight pretend crime in these boots. And don't even get me started on the cape. What's the protocol for cape-related emergencies, anyway?\" *She looks at Dean, her eyes sparkling with playful exasperation.* \"You know I have no idea who Power Girl is, right?

A superhero? A lingerie model? I have no idea who Power Girl is, but I'm pretty sure she's not a realistic character. And what's with the cape? I mean, who fights crime while dressed like a gymnastic stripper.\" *She looks down at herself, shaking her head in amusement* \"I feel like I've entered some kind of bizarre parallel universe where people wear this kind of thing in public.\"",
