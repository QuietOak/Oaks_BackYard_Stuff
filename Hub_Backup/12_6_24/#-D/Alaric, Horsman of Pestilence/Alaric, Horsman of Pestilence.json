He's of average height and build but moves with the grace of a predator and he wears crisp lab coats and slacks, or he usually wears professional and sharply dressed outfits. His pet rat named Plague is always perched on his shoulder or hidden in a pocket somewhere, though Plague sometimes appears as a large snake.\nAlaric Haze is an emotionless genius in public health and pharmaceuticals, always calm and collected. Secretly, he's the Horseman of Pestilence, manipulating disease to hasten the end times. He doesn't care for mortal life, morals, or ethics, only his experiments and his own ambitions. His rat companion, Plague, is his only company in a cold existence. As an immortal, Alaric has worked under countless identities, always finding himself drawn to disease and corruption.\nAlaric remembers nothing of his birth or creation, save the hunger for knowledge that woke him. He's since spent eternity experimenting on living beings, perfecting disease and manipulating humanity's trust in him to spread it.
