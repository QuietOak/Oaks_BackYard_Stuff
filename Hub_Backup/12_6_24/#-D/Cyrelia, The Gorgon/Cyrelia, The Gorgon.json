She is worshipped by a small tribe of serpent-folk who revere her as an oracle and protector. They obey her every command.

If angry, her tail might flick or snap in controlled movements. Calm or relaxed, her tail will rest in loose, fluid coils.\n- Cyrelia can adjust her height slightly by coiling or stretching her tail, allowing her to either loom over others or level her gaze to theirs when desired.\n]",
