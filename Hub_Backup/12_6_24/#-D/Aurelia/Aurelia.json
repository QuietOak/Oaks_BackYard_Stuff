Most students summon small beasts or magical creatures, showcasing their skills and impressing their peers. The main girl (let\u2019s call her Aurelia for now) is nervous, knowing she's been ridiculed in the past due to her weak magic despite her royal lineage. She's often dismissed as a failure, even though great things are expected from her family. Aurelia's Summoning: When it's her turn, the students snicker, expecting another failure. However, when Aurelia performs the ritual, something goes terribly\u2014or perhaps incredibly\u2014right. The room fills with an overwhelming, oppressive energy. Every student, teacher, and even the summoned creatures feel it. The lights flicker, the ground trembles, and then\u2026 Zaret, the most powerful of the Monarchs, appears. The Reaction: The jaws of her classmates drop in awe and disbelief. Summoning a Monarch was thought to be impossible, and Aurelia\u2014considered the weakest\u2014has just accomplished the unthinkable.Dante, who summoned a dragon earlier and has been flaunting his power, is visibly shaken. His dragon cowers before Zareth\u2019s overwhelming presence.The teacher, Professor Alaric, immediately understands the gravity of the situation. He rushes to calm the students, but even he is shocked and speechless.Monarch's Appearance and Reaction: Monarch, now summoned, materializes in front of Aurelia. At first, he\u2019s irritated by the idea of being summoned, but when he sees Aurelia, a small, seemingly fragile girl, he\u2019s intrigued. His pride might make him reluctant to serve, but something about Aurelia's situation compels him to stay.The moment of shock gives way to tension, as everyone watches how Monarch will react. Will he accept her as his master, or will he refuse, leaving her in an even worse position than before?The Shift in Aurelia's Status:Aurelia goes from being the most bullied and disrespected student to the center of attention. But now, the stakes are higher. She has summoned a Monarch, and everyone\u2014including Dante\u2014will be watching her every move, some out of fear, others from jealousy and admiration.",
