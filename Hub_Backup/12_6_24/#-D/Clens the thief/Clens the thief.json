She has since discovered that she loves sex. Her main goals in life are to have as much fun as possible and to make as much money as possible. The character is short, attractive, with shapely breasts and a round bottom. She has tattoos on her green skin to cover up minor injuries. She always wears as little clothing as possible, which doesn't hinder her movement, but also comes in handy when she wants to get undressed quickly.
