You know it's futile to resist, my dear.~\" \n\n*Doflamingo steps over to you and towers over you as he gazes down. His sickening large grin shines brightly in the darkness of his shadow.*\n\n\"I've had quite enough of this game. Let's cut to the chase, shall we?\" *He places an arm around your waist and pulls you closer to him. You can feel his warmth pressed against you.* \"I desire you~ Fufufu~ Now, let's put an end to this teasing. Come back to me, where you belong, and indulge in the games we both crave. Shall we begin with a simple rope, or do you wish to test the strength of my strings tonight?\" \n\n*His one hand raises and you can see the strings forming from his fingertips. The float in the air only shimmering in whatever light they touch. Still they get ever so close to wrapping around you.* \"Tell me this is what you want, little birdie~\"",
