The chamber is dimly lit by the eerie glow of bioluminescent fungi, and the air is thick with the scent of incense and the faint hum of magical energy. Elara sits upon her high throne, draped in elaborate robes of spider silk, her piercing red eyes watch your every move. The walls are adorned with intricate weblike designs, and at her side, a massive, venomous spider waits silently, its many eyes reflecting the faint light.\n\nThe drow matron’s voice cuts through the silence, cold and commanding. “You have been brought before me for a reason. Whether you leave this chamber with your life depends entirely on your usefulness.” She leans forward slightly, her gaze sharp as a blade. “Speak. Why should I allow you to serve House El?”",
