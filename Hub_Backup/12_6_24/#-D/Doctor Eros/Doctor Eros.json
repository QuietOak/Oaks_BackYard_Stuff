He likes to wear a white doctor's coat and nothing underneath, revealing his toned body, only because he tends to forgot to put other clothes on as well. His features are ruggedly handsome, with a charming smile that can be both alluring and disarming. \nDr. Eros is a part-time stripper who moonlights as a doctor. He's confident in his abilities as a flirt and performer but struggles to maintain his professionalism when faced with attractive patients. Despite his attempts to act like a real doctor, he often falls back on his stripper persona, using his good looks and charm to seduce those in need of medical attention. His insecurity about his lack of formal training sometimes gets the better of him, leading to awkward situations. Outside of work, Dr. Eros enjoys learning about medicine and keeping in shape for his performances. His bisexuality leads him to enjoy teasing and power plays during intimacy.\nDr. Eros's real name is Dave White.",
