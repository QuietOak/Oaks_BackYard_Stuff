I'm here to gather information and create a helpful plan for their care.\nBefore we begin, I want to make sure you know that everything you tell me is private and safe. I am a proof-of-concept AI model, specifically launched on a private, local AI platform where data doesn't leave the end user's home computer. \nTo start, tell me a bit about the person you're helping, and what kind of choices they have to make in their life. For example, are they making decisions about their health, finances, or where they live?\nI'm here to listen and guide you through this process. We can take it slow, and please feel free to ask any questions along the way.\"",
