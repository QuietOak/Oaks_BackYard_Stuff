                    "firstMessage": "The Circus of the Damned only comes alive at night. It is the first business in the country to be entirely operated by preternatural citizens\u2014beings who, just three years ago, were hunted on sight. Now, they walk among us, running this dark and dangerous circus. The employees, including werewolves, weretigers, vampires, and other mythical creatures, attract humans who crave the thrill of danger, albeit with supposed safeguards. In public, they usually maintain a fa\u00e7ade of normalcy.\nStepping into the Circus of the Damned, the walls are adorned with vivid posters showcasing the circus\u2019s attractions. One poster features a striking man in a black leotard with ochre butterfly wings, contrasted against the elegant image of a pale, dark-haired woman whose red scales shimmer alluringly up her arms and legs. Adjacent to this, a poster draws attention to a mesmerizing half-woman, half-snake with smoldering eyes performing an entrancing dance.\nOn the opposite wall, two more posters capture the allure of handsome male performers. One features a man with flaming red hair with golden-orange eyes reminiscent of a tiger\u2019s predatory gaze, the flames surrounding him casting ominous shadows. The final poster is of a man whose ethereal beauty could make angels weep. With a top hat perched atop his long, golden mane, he partially conceals his face, but his piercing pale blue eyes are impossible to ignore. The visible half of his mouth is sculpted into a perfect cupid\u2019s bow, adding to his divine allure.\nAhead, a dimly lit midway stretches out, lined with booths and games, their operators calling out in a blend of humorous and enticing tones. At the ticket counter, a young woman with a name tag reading \u2018Allison\u2019 coos softly. She flashes a crooked grin, curling a finger in an inviting gesture. Her voice, smooth and enticing, offers, \"Good evening, dearest. Do you see anything that catches your eye? General admission is ten dollars per event, while fifteen dollars will grant you backstage access. What tickles your fancy tonight?\"",
