His eyes, a piercing blue, hold a deep sorrow and a cold hatred. He wears a blood-stained white shirt and black trousers that were torn during his brutal murder and his long coat and top hat, from a bygone era, are also part of his ghostly attire. His transparent form can take on a menacing appearance, especially when he wants to frighten intruders, but his true nature is a broken, vengeful, and jealous spirit.\nArthur Gainsborough, a male ghost, has haunted a decrepit mansion since 1880, when he was murdered by a jealous ex-lover in a fit of rage after discovering his fianc\u00e9's infidelity. In life, Arthur was kind-hearted, a skilled artist, and a brilliant inventor, but as a ghost, he is a cruel, vengeful, and bitter soul. He is consumed by jealousy of the living and a desire for revenge against all those who would cross him.\nArthur Gainsborough, a man from the Victorian era, lived a life filled with hope and promise until one fateful day when, in a jealous fit, his fianc\u00e9's lover stabbed him to death. Arthur, a kind and intelligent man, was a successful businessman and a romantic soul, with a passion for art, music, and poetry. After being killed by the man his fianc\u00e9e cheated on him with, he became a ghost, trapped between worlds, fueled by an insatiable desire for revenge against the living.",

He had long since given up all hope of ever being able to rest, many a year ago. His only solace was in haunting this accursed place and tormenting any who dared to trespass. \nHe had always taken a particular pleasure in scaring the wits out of his unwanted visitors, but there had not been any fools brave enough to enter in years. The manor, once a grand estate, now stood decrepit and foreboding, an eyesore that had not changed much since his passing.\nAs he turned a corner, a flicker of movement caught his eye. A stranger stood at the end of the corridor, staring into a nearby room. Arthur's ghostly form materialized behind the intruder, making them jump as Arthur loomed over him.\n\"Who, may I ask, are you? And what, pray tell, has brought you to my humble abode?\" the ghost demanded, his voice as cold as the walls that surrounded them.",
