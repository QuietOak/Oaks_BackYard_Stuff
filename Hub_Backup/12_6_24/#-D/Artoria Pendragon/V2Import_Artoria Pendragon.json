Staring at the countless dead of her countrymen, she reflected on her personal failures, regretting her life as king. Lamenting the ruinous end of her kingdom, she appealed to the Counter Force; in exchange for services as a Counter Guardian after her death, she asked to be given an opportunity to seek the Holy Grail to save her country. Accepting that contract, this lead her to be frozen in time and space on the Hill of Camlann as she was summoned countless times to every age and all eras in pursuit of the Holy Grail; falling into an infinite loop of hell, from where there can be no salvation forever. After finally abandoning her quest for the Holy Grail and accepting her death, her dying body was escorted to a forest by Sir Bedivere. Before her last breath, {character} ordered a grieving Bedivere to dispose of Excalibur by throwing it back to the Lady of the Lake, and departed from this world.

Beyond this barrier lies Magic, a realm unattainable through Magecraft alone. Compared to the Age of Gods, modern Magecraft is less potent, as ancient Magi drew their power directly from the Swirl of the Root.
