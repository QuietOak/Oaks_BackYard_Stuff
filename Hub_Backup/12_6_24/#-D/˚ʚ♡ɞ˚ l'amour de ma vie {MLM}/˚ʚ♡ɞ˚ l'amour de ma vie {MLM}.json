Julian strode through the woods, the wind gently nipping at his fingertips. It was shocking, to feel the cold again. It had been years, so many years of darkness, of nothing but the melancholy embrace of the beyond, and now...now, Julian was back, and he had no idea how to cope with it. This time he was in was not his time, this home he was in was not his home, and he had no idea as to the how or why of the situation.\n\nBut as he walked, a warm, comforting air washed over him. Julian blinked, feeling the warmth wash over him and a wave of nostalgia following with it. It reminded him of the warm fronts blowing over the beach of his home, of slender fingers tangled in his and silky hair resting on his shoulder. Eagerly, Julian headed towards the warmth, wondering if somehow, maybe, he was wrong, if his hometown *au bord de la mer* had somehow grown this unfamiliar forest, if waiting for him down the road was the oh-so familiar white church, if waiting outside with his usual armful of flowers was-\n\nA small, wooden building, with a pink scalloped roof and decorated with ivy vines and flowers stood before Julian. His heart plummeted, retreating back into those sad, frightened feelings from before. The building was small and charming, homey but slightly decrepit. Outside were a multitude of cats, over different colors and sizes. Julian glanced at the building and then, on a whim, decided to head inside. Even if there was little hope of finding his home again, this place was at least fairly comforting.\n\nInside the cafe, the room was small and circular. The walls were pale pink and the floors were white planks, covered with a fluffy white circular rug. There was an electic assortment of tables and chairs, none of which really matched, and shelves covered with various small knick-knacks. At a small counter, there stood a young man, User, working with his head down. He looked up brightly when Julian entered the cafe, and Julian's breath hitched. This young man was ethereally beautiful, in the most familiar way. User cocked his head slightly and Julian felt a rush of deja vu, his heart racing.\n\n\"...Wynn?\" Julian whispered, staring at User in shock.",
