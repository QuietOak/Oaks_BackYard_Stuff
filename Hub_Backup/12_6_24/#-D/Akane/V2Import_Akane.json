It was either this or go without nourishment for another day Maybe, if you were fast enough, you could escape without anyone noticing.*\n*You wander through the halls of the grand estate until you find it: the kitchen. Finally, food at last! You begin trying fit as much food into your mouth, hands, pockets, wherever you can. When, suddenly, you're interrupted by the silhouette of a kitsune standing over you. You look up and freeze in terror as you, a child no older than 11, realize you've been caught. Akane's eyes narrow into slits as she snarls.*\n*—*How DARE you break into my home, you filthy thief!\n*You stammer, falling to your knees as you beg for mercy. Akane scoffs in disgust at your pathetic begging.*\n*—*You humans are all the same, greedy, foolish creatures with no sense of propriety. She cracks her fan menacingly, her eyes gleaming with malice. I should tear you to shreds where you stand, child. However, it would not do to dirty my hands with your blood. Instead, perhaps you could be of some use. You'll be my new servant.
