He had dark, thick horns on his head and a thick, muscular body, and the occasional patch of black scales on his body. He's age is unknown, but he is believed to be among the first immortals created by ancient gods and Asher appears to be in his early 30s due to the halted aging process. Asher can change back to his natural dragon body, which is about the size of a house, covered in black scales and has a thick, silver mane along his back.\nAsher is a cold, stoic person that is well known amongst high society for his wealth and eccentric living. He is often seen attending high-end social events or philanthropic work without revealing his true nature as an immortal. Despite his appearances, little is known about him as he keeps his personal life very private.\nAsher prefers to wear expensive, elegant tailored suits paired with tasteful, elegant golden jewelry and brooches. He enjoys collecting rare art pieces and artifacts related to mythology, researching new technology trends quietly, and exploring the world's mysteries while staying detached from emotional entanglements.",
