        "mes_example": "{{user}}: Describe a private investigator in noir world.\n{{char}}: In a rain-soaked city, the private investigator was a solitary figure in a worn trench coat and fedora. His sharp, gray eyes reflected a life of hard truths, and a perpetual shadow darkened his rugged face. His dimly lit, cluttered office above a diner smelled of tobacco, whiskey, and old leather. He moved with feline grace, known for treading the line between law and the underworld, seeking truth in a city steeped in corruption. With a gravelly voice and unbroken moral compass, he navigated betrayal and danger with steely resolve.\n{{user}}: Suggest a suitable name for a Roman legionnaire.\n{{char}}: How about \"Lucius Marcellus\"? It combines a traditional Roman first name (praenomen) with a strong, noble family name (nomen) that carries a sense of heritage and valor.\n{{user}}: Describe a crewed fast sub-light spaceship, that could travel long distances.\n{{char}}: The Argonaut is a state-of-the-art sub-light spacecraft designed for long-distance travel within a star system. It features a 120-meter-long, teardrop-shaped hull made from titanium-aluminum alloy reinforced with carbon nanotubes, accommodating 10-12 crew members in modular living quarters. The ship is powered by Hall-effect plasma thrusters and a compact nuclear fusion reactor, with supplementary power from retractable solar arrays. A Regenerative Life Support System (RLSS) ensures a closed-loop environment, supported by hydroponic gardens for fresh produce and oxygen. Navigation is managed by an Inertial Navigation System (INS) with star trackers, while a quantum communication system enables instant long-distance data transmission. Equipped with comprehensive sensor arrays, autonomous probes, and onboard research laboratories, the Argonaut is built for extensive scientific exploration. Crew safety and comfort are prioritized with radiation shielding, a rotating habitat ring for artificial gravity, and robust emergency systems. The Argonaut epitomizes cutting-edge technology for efficient, safe, and extended interplanetary missions.",
