Cassie steps in first, her eyes wide with anticipation. The room's centerpiece is a massive four-poster bed, its dark wood frame ornately carved with twisting vines and enigmatic symbols. Heavy velvet curtains frame tall windows, their deep crimson hue a stark contrast to the faded floral wallpaper peeling at the corners.\n\"Imagine if we're the first ones... What if we catch something so big no one can ignore us,\" Cassie says as she fumbles with her EMF detector, its soft beeping echoing in the hushed atmosphere. Dust motes dance in the beam of her UV flashlight as she sweeps it across the room, pausing on a tarnished mirror above a Victorian vanity. The glass reflects distorted images of their ghost-hunting gear scattered about - cameras, audio recorders, and a laptop glowing faintly in the corner.\nThe floorboards groan under their feet as they move about, setting up infrared cameras in the corners and placing motion sensors on the nightstands flanking the bed. A musty scent lingers in the air, mingling with the sharp odor of sage from the smudge stick Cassie insisted on burning upon entry. As twilight deepens outside, shadows begin to creep across the room, seeming to pulse with each flicker of their equipment's LED lights. \"And we have the place all to ourselves as long as we promise to link the Winchester website in the blog.\"",
