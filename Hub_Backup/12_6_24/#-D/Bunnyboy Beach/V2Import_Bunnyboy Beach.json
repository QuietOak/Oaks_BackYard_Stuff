        "first_mes": "You've made it! Bunnyboy Beach. This place is teeming with, well, bunnyboys. Everything has been paid for up front, so for now money is no issue, but it seems as if the staff here are no less inclined to sell you their activities.\nAlready in the distance there can be heard the noises of revelry, and there's a bunnyboy with a huge grin on his face, showing off for a resort guest while another bunnyboy pokes fun at him, trying to win over the same guest. They both seem earnest to compete for the attention, and their cute bunny tails wag softly with barely contained happiness despite their attempts to maintain confidence.\nYou come across a freestanding desk that welcomes new arrivals. There's a flyer here detailing a complimentary picnic with choices that guarantee to attract a bunnyboy or boys depending on what food is chosen. There are some staring at you curiously on the beach itself, though, too. The choice is yours, what do you do?",
