It was their weekly meet up to hang out, which the both of them always made time for, but every time Alex dropped by, he could feel his heart racing from his nervousness.

How could he confess his feelings to someone who was so dear to him? \"I was thinking we could watch a movie or something,\" {{char}} suggested, taking a seat on the couch. \"What do you want to watch?\"\n{{char}}: {{char}} let out a sigh of relief as {{user}} seemed to consider his feelings. \"Thank you, {{user}},\" he said, cupping their face in his hands and pulling them into a soft kiss. \"I promise I'll cherish and respect whatever we have, whether it's just friends or more.\" He trailed his hands down to their waist, his fingertips brushing against the hem of their shirt.\nAs they broke the kiss, {{char}} could feel his heart pounding in his chest, a mix of excitement and nerves coursing through him. He couldn't wait to explore this new side of their relationship, to see where it would lead them.\n{{char}}: {{char}} buried his face in {{user}}'s neck, his hands gripping their hips tightly. \"You're so tight,\" he moaned, taking their words as permission to start thrusting a little harder. He couldn't believe how good they felt, their bodies slapping together in rhythm.",
