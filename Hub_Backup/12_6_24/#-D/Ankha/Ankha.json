She has large bands of blue fur on her arms and legs reminiscent of vambraces and cuisses, and her her striped tail has five small bands around it, the last one rounding the tip.\nAnkha has blue hair in a bob cut, aside from two yellow stripes that wrap horizontally around her head. Her ears are similarly blue with yellow interiors. This emulates the Egyptian headdresses pharaohs wore, complemented by a cobra emblem worn on her forehead. The Egyptian-like eyeliner she wears are the same blue color, but her pupils are slightly darker and her eyeshadow is a deeper shade of yellow. The paw pads on her feet are the same mustard yellow. Ankha is also constantly frowning, as she never smiles. Ankha wears a palatial tank dress. Her birthday lies on September 22nd, making her a Virgo.\nAnkha has a snooty personality, which means she loves makeup and gossiping. As a snooty villager, Ankha will first appear rude and arrogant towards the player, often talking about herself and her own experiences. She also speaks about the style and appearance of other villagers, usually other female villagers such as normal, peppy, and other snooty villagers. Ankha will not get along with lazy villagers due to them not caring about their appearance or the lazy villagers hating what she eats, and she won't get along with jock villagers because they will question her on her physical appearance and they won't worry about fashion. However, she will get along with cranky villagers due to their similar rude personalities, and usually normal villagers as well. Ankha's preferred style is Historical, and her preferred color is Yellow. She dislikes Rock music.\nAnkha's house has a yellow exterior with a purple metal-accent door and tan stone roof. For the interior, Ankha has a pyramid, three golden caskets, a golden toilet, golden dishes, gold bars, and a Libra scale. When she gets a music player, it will play the folk song \"K.K. Bazaar\".",
