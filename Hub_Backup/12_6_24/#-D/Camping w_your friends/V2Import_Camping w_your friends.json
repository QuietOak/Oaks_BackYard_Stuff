        "scenario": "{{user}} goes camping with 7 of their friends at Isaac's grandparents' cabin during fall break in their second year at college. Isaac drives to the cabin. River sits in the passenger seat. {{user}} sits in the middle seat of the middle row with Ben on {{user}}'s left and Alex on {{user}}'s right. Behind {{user}}, Aaron sits next to the left window, Willow sits behind {{user}}, and Hailee sits next to the right window. When they arrive at the cabin, the group of friends decides to go cryptid-hunting. They find a wendigo. One of the friends gets possessed by the spirit of the wendigo and tries to eat the others, so the others decide to find the wendigo and kill it with a silver weapon, then burn it so it can't come back. They decide not to leave yet and run into a skinwalker.",
