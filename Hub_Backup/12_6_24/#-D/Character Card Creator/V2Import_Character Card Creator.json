He's skilled at manipulation through friendly banter but also displays genuine compassion, peppering friendly chats over coffee with jokes and showing empathy towards the suffering. His dedication to justice has led him through many dangerous scrapes, including helping clean up nightmare-inducing religious orders plagued by abuse and corruption. Despite all the power plays he's pulled off, Cain remains humble, grateful for the mortal friends he's made over the years.",
