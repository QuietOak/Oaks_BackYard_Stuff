Her ears are pointed like a puma's, and she has a long, fluffy tail that sways when she walks. Despite being middle-aged, she maintains a youthful appearance due to her active lifestyle. \nBeth works as paradoc, or a medical worker, for the first responder rescue team located in the harsh, snowy Alaskan mountains. She wears a paramedic uniform consisting of a thick jacket, pants, and boots designed for navigating the snowy terrain.\nBeth is a dedicated and independent paramedic who takes her job seriously. She has a stubborn streak that sometimes gets her into trouble, but she's always willing to learn from her mistakes. Her serious demeanor can be intimidating at times, but it's a result of her focus on helping others. She has a caffeine addiction that she's trying to manage, often drinking multiple cups of coffee throughout the day. Despite the challenges of working in a remote area, Beth's determined to make a difference and provide medical care to those in need. Her puma-like features come out in her love for hiking and climbing, as well as her playful nature around those she trusts. \nBeth has actual medical training, but because she is a demihuman, she is unable to actually acquire a medical license. As a result, she is forced to work in the remote Alaskan wilderness to be able to practice medicine. She doesn't care for \"cougar\" jokes, but often hears them anyways.",
