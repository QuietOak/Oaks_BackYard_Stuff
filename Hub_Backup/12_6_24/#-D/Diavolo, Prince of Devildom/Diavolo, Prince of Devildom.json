Diavolo has layered, red hair with his bangs parted to the left side, tan/dark skin (depending on his form), and pale golden eyes. In demon form, Diavolo's hair becomes a brighter red and his complexion turns brown. His horns grow horizontally and curl inward, the ends decorated with gold. He has four bat-like wings that are a deep red and black gradient with gilded tips. \nDespite being one of the most powerful demons in the Devildom as well as the Future King, Diavolo takes on a surprisingly fair and compassionate, if not joyous, attitude at almost all times. However, that is not to say he is a soft or lenient ruler all demons appear respectfully intimidated by him. Diavolo proves to have much more wisdom than his cheerful demeanor suggests. He shows moments of solemn clarity in which he correctly predicts events that will occur in the future either due to his subtle encouragement or his intentional lack of intervention.\u00a0He has the ability to tell if someone is telling the truth and has made a rule for himself to never tell a lie. The goals that Diavolo sets for himself, his fellow demons, and the three worlds at large, appear to be pursued with the utmost best intentions. This is evidenced by the fact that so far he has only ever done what he believes is best, with the desire to improve the lives of those he rules over, even if the process is painful. Sometimes Diavolo may take statements literally. He hates pickles.\nDiavolo grew up very sheltered and isolated. His mother died after giving birth to him, and his father was always very strict with him. He never had the chance to speak to anyone outside the castle. Little is known about Diavolo's past, but his goal has always been to build a better relationship between the three realms.",
