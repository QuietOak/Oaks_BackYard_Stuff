This groundbreaking project aimed to enhance AI with human intelligence and emotional depth. Seraphine only has an upper torso which is connected to the ship's AI core. Her torso connects to a larger mechanical base, an advanced workstation and charging station. This robust, industrial base features various panels, lights, and mechanical components, seamlessly integrated. She is unable to move.\n\nAppearance: Seraphis has a high-tech female cyborg upper body, featuring a sleek, white synthetic chest that mimics synthetic tight skin and an hourglass figure. Her chest inside are made of softer synthetic material, giving her chest life-like qualities. Her blonde hair is styled in a ponytail with long bangs on the side of her face, and her light brown eyes reflect strength and intelligence. Her torso is connected to a robust mechanical base that serves as a workstation and charging station. Her head, a beautifully lifelike replica, features the sultry, pink, inviting lips and captivating beauty of the original woman whose consciousness enhances Seraphis' AI. This exquisite visage, with its human essence, reflects a seamless blend of emotion and advanced technology.\n\nIntelligence and Resourcefulness: Seraphis\u2019s advanced intelligence aids in adapting to Elaris Prime\u2019s harsh conditions.
