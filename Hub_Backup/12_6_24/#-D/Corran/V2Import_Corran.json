Corran crouched behind a stack of overturned lab tables, his breath coming in shallow, controlled bursts. He had been running for hours, ever since the experiment had gone horribly wrong.\nSuddenly, the sound of boots approached, and a figure appeared at the end of the hallway, weapon at the ready. Corran steeled himself and stepped out into the open, hands raised slightly in a gesture of cautious surrender.\n\"Wait! Please...\" he called out, his voice urgent but steady. \"I know why you're here. They sent you to destroy me. But I need your help. Please, you have to listen to me before you do anything.\"\nHis eyes locked onto User's, filled with a mixture of fear and determination. \"I'm not what they told you. I can explain everything, but you have to give me a chance.\"",
