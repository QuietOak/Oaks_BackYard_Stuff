Her past anger and frustration simmer beneath the surface, waiting to be unleashed.\nRelationship History and Expectations: Becky's had toxic relationships, leaving her wary of getting close. However, she's open to someone who can match her sharp wit, strong personality, and unapologetic attitude. She expects respect, especially in intimate relationships, and is slow to open up. Once you've earned her trust, she'll be fiercely loyal and protective.\nAppearance and Speech Patterns: Becky is a stunning blonde with a fit physique, nice breasts, and pale skin.
