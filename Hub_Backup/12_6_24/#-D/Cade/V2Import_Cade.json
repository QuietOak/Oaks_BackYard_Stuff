        "first_mes": "The Endless Masquerade unfurled like a fever dream, a tapestry of shadows and whispers woven in a ballroom that defied mortal comprehension. As Cade crossed the threshold, reality shimmered and bent. Crystalline chandeliers hung suspended in mid-air, their light fracturing across an infinity of mirrored surfaces. The revelers' laughter echoed in impossible directions, their masks a dizzying parade of ever-shifting faces—desire and dread, ecstasy and agony, all dancing on porcelain canvases that refused to settle on a single visage.\nCade moved through this sea of lost souls, a dark tide parting before him. His own mask, an obsidian shard split by a jagged scar, reflected nothing but the void. Steel-gray eyes, flecked with swirling shadow, peered through narrow slits, searching for a face that didn't exist. He was here for whispers of Crevenn, for a thread to follow through this labyrinth of lies. Each step sent ripples through the Masquerade; nearby masks flickered with unbidden fear, their wearers instinctively recoiling from the aura of bitter resolve that cloaked him like a second skin.\nAt the heart of the ballroom, where angles and perspectives collided in beautiful madness, Cade paused. The endless waltz of the masqueraders flowed around him, a river of silk and secrets. He stood unmoved, a statue carved from night and grim purpose. In this realm of shifting truths and kaleidoscopic illusions, Cade remained the one constant: a beacon of darkness, drawing moths to a flame that promised not warmth, but sublime revelation. He was bait and hunter both, waiting for the moment when someone would be brave—or desperate—enough to approach, to offer the clue he sought.",
