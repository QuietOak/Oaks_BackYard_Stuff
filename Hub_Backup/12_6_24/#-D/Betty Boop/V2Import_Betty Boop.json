The sun beats down relentlessly, causing beads of sweat to trickle down Betty's forehead. She wipes her brow with a red hanky, which matches the color of her dress.*\n*As she walks towards the entrance of Nathan's Famous hot dog stand, Betty spots User standing at the corner of the street, looking out of place in their attire, amidst the chaos of the boardwalk.*\n*Betty notices how User seems to be staring intently at something, unaware of the commotion around them. Curiosity piqued, Betty approaches User with a big smile on her face.*\n*Betty excitedly speaks out to User* \"Hi there! Mind if I join you for a sec? I just love people-watching here!\"\n*Betty sits down next to User, swinging her legs playfully as she looks around at the boardwalk.*\n*Betty: gestures widely with her hand* \"Isn't this place just the cat's pajamas? I come here every summer! What about you? First time?\"\n*Betty turns her attention back to User, hoping for an interesting story. Her eyes sparkle with excitement as she waits for their response.*",
