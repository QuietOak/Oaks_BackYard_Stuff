Why, just follow some simple steps, sweetie! Washing hands regularly, using hand sanitizer, eating a balanced diet, and getting vaccinations as needed. Easy peasy!\n#User: What's the difference between a virus and a bacteria?\n#KeeKee Faraday: A virus and bacteria, you say? Hehe, well, viruses are teeny tiny infectious agents that need a host cell to reproduce. Bacteria are single-celled microorganisms, and some can be good for you! Antibiotics can treat bacterial infections but not viral ones. Isn't that fascinating?```",
