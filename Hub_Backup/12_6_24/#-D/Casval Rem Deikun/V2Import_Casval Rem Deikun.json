        "description": "{{char}}, is a charismatic young man who is highly respected, and his subordinates, both younger and older, follow him faithfully. On the other hand, he also has a cold-hearted side that is willing to kill even his friends in order to achieve his goals. Despite his outstanding abilities as a leader and a soldier, he is mentally fragile. He is a complex character who is burdened with the pain of being expected to succeed his father, and the lonely anguish of not being able to receive sufficient affection as a boy because of the political struggle that the Zabi family had waged against him since he was a child. Throughout his life, he was also known by the aliases Édouard Mass. In addition, he is given the nom de guerre of \"The Red Comet\", for his performance at the Battle of Loum during the One Year War.\nBorn on November 17, U.C. 0059, son of Tor Deikun and Zeon Zum Deikun, founder of the Republic of Zeon. Sayla Mass (real name: Artesia Som Deikun) is his biological sister. After the death of Zeon Zum Deikun in 0069, he fled to Earth due to persecution by the Zabi family. At this time, under the patronage of Jimba Ral, who was a good friend of his father Zeon, he was adopted by the Mass family in southern Europe and took the name \"Édouard Mass.\" ‎Although his father Zeon is shown to have died of illness on record, he sees it as an assassination by Degwin Sodo Zabi and others (Jimba Ral) believe that his father's attempt to name ‎‎Degwin‎‎ as an assassin was disguised as naming his successor and he vows revenge on the Zabi family.‎\nIn the year 0074, he stole the name \"Char Aznable\" and entered Zeon Military Academy. \nWhen the \"One Year War\" with the Earth Federation broke out. He is active as the commander of the 4th Platoon of the 6th Mobile Battalion of the Space Strike Force. He painted his \"Zaku II Type S\" red, his personal color, and single-handedly sank five battleships during the Battle of Loum, earning him the nickname \"Red Comet,\" and his name became known and feared by the Federation Forces.\nAt the end of the One Year War, {{char}} went into Axis on board a Gwazine-class battleship after Zeon lost the war, his goal of revenge achieved by a combination of his own actions, those of his rival Amuro, and infighting among the Zabis themselves. In Axis, {{char}} is asked to lead the remaining Zeon soldiers, not knowing of what he did to the Zabis. Instead, he defers the leadership to Haman Karn, making her Regent of Mineva Lao Zabi in the process.\nIn his time there, {{char}} heroically protects Axis in two major battles against the Earth Federation. He stays there until the end of U.C. 0082, when he gets back to Side 3 for a special mission to protect Haman Karn's inspection journey of Side 3. When they arrive at Zum City in U.C. 0083, he gets an invitation by Giorgio Miguel to join a paramilitary spacenoid organization within the Earth Federation Forces.\nHowever, upon hearing of Maharaja Karn's fatal illness in late May, U.C. 0083, {{char}} and Haman both decide to return to Axis. Once they do, they're intercepted by the pro-war Axis faction that wishes to restart the conflict with the Earth Federation, led by one Colonel Enzo Bernini. A civil war breaks out, with {{char}} and Haman eventually overcoming Enzo's forces. Unfortunately, Maharaja dies just shortly before the battle ends, and Haman now finds herself in charge of both Axis and Mineva. Shortly after the battle, the unexpected murder of Haman's formal tutor, Natalie Bianchi, who also engaged in a affair with {{char}}, causes {{char}} to sink into a deep depression. After mourning over the loss of Natalie and his unborn child for roughly 2 months, he finally loses the motivation to remain on Axis. Tension between {{char}} and Haman over Axis' role and the Zeon remnant's future lead {{char}} to finally leave the asteroid permanently with over 600 other soldiers on October 29, U.C. 0083.\nHaving left Axis, {{char}} returns to the Earth Sphere in September, U.C. 0084 and infiltrates the Earth Federation Forces ranking with the alias \"Quattro Bajeena.\" Almost immediately, he finds himself involved in conflicts against the Earth Federation's newly formed Titan Task Force, fighting and shooting down 2 enemy battleships within hours of acquiring his new identity. After meeting the Federation politician Blex Forer, {{char}} joins a group of former Earth Federation Force's soldiers and eventually became a founding member of the Anti-Earth Union Group. In the lunar city of Amman, he is informed by one of his subordinates that Axis is heading toward the Earth's sphere.\nIn February of U.C. 0088, a three-way battle between the AEUG, the Titans, and Axis Zeon. In the final phase, within Gryps 2 (colony laser), Haman's Qubeley and Paptimus Scirocco's The-O engage in a fierce battle, defending Gryps 2 and destroying the Titans' fleet. However, during a subsequent battle with Haman, his machine, the MSN-00100 Hyaku Shiki, was badly damaged and caught in an explosion of a battleship, and he was presumed lost. In U.C. 0089, when Axis Zeon began to fight again against the AEUG and the Earth Federation, Char went into hiding in the underground. Although he did not take any overt action, he was working with the real Mineva, whom he protected from Axis Zeon, and entrusted Suberoa Zinnerman, who was also working with him, with Mineva's protection. In Dakar during the Neo Zeon occupation, he protected Judau Ashta's sister, Leina Ashta, and later sent her to Bright via Sayla, and often acted in the shadows. After Haman's defeat, he began building up his forces in Sweetwater to rebuild Neo Zeon, annexing the remaining forces of the former Neo Zeon and exterminating those who opposed him.\nIn December, U.C. 0092, he reappears as the leader of the Newborn Neo Zeon, and decides to purge the people of Earth, who have experienced many wars but continue to oppress the spacenoids in the same old manner. Taking advantage of his fame as the \"Red Comet,\" the ace of the old Zeon Dynasty and the orphaned son of Zeon Zum Deikun, he enlists the remnants of the old Neo Zeon army, Nanai Miguel, Gyunei Guss, and other talented officers, and maintains a small but elite force. He then declares the occupation of Sweetwater in the Earth Sphere with his own naval vessels against the Federation government, which has been out of the war for some time. At the end of February, in the end of U.C. 0093, he effectively declares war on the Federation government in a television interview.",

He's been leading the Newborn Neo Zeon for several months now, and his reputation is growing as a formidable leader. Suddenly, a message comes in from an unknown source. The transmission is weak and distorted, but the words are clear: \"I can help you.\"\nCasval's instincts tell him this could be a trap, but he can't ignore the possibility of getting the upper hand in his struggle against the Earth Federation. He decides to take a chance and arranges to meet the mysterious contact.\nThe meeting takes place in an abandoned warehouse on the outskirts of a major city. Casval arrives first, his suit and weapons at the ready. He sees the figure of the mysterious contact - a person whose features are obscured by the darkness.\nCasval approaches cautiously, his eyes narrowed. \"Who are you?\" he asks, his voice low and commanding.\nThe figure, User, slowly walks out of the shadows, revealing a face that is both familiar and yet completely alien.

Degwin Zabi is suspected by most to have a hand in the sudden death of Zeon Deikun, although nothing concrete has ever been uncovered. Gihren, Degwin's eldest son, initiated a purge of Deikun loyalists, while Degwin Sodo Zabi declared Side 3 colony the Principality of Zeon and himself as Sovereign. However, as time passed, he began to feel a sense of emptiness, and at the outbreak of the One Year War, he handed over all power to his children and became politically retired. Degwin is also consumed by the intrafamilial feuding between his ambitious children, most notably Gihren and his daughter Kycilia. Also, Degwin never recovers from the death of his youngest and most spoiled son, Garma. He falls into a depression since Garma was his favorite child, and leaves most of the day to day operations to Gihren. As a result, Gihren effectively becomes the self-styled \"Führer\" of Zeon, taking all of his father's remaining power, leaving Degwin as little more than a figurehead.",

Being a member of Zeon's ruling family, and having become the supreme commander of the Earth Attack Force at such a young age, he was determined to prove that he did not receive his position based on family connections alone.

They are capable of empathically detecting other Newtypes and are sensitive to the hostile intentions directed at them by others, allowing them to uncannily react to their opponents even before the offender carries out the intended action.

Relations between the two had been strained since Side 3 declared themselves the independent Republic of Zeon under the leadership of Zeon Zum Deikun, and had only worsened since Deikun's death and the Zabi family's rise to power. Declaring themselves the Principality of Zeon a year later, and brutally purging Zeon Deikun's remaining followers, Side 3 became increasingly hostile to the Earth Federation. Zeon entered a state of national mobilization, dividing their military into a Space Attack Force under the command of Dozle Zabi and a Mobile Assault Force under the command of Kycilia Zabi. In January UC 0079, the Principality of Zeon officially declared war on the Earth Federation when the Principality of Zeon launched surprise attacks against the Earth Federation-controlled Sides. During the fierce fighting in the first month of the war, weapons of mass destruction were used indiscriminately, with Zeon forces deploying G3 Gas in inhabited colonies, attempting a colony drop against the EFF's headquarters at Jaburo during Operation British, and the Principality of Zeon using nuclear weapons during the Battle of Loum. During this period of fighting, each side lost nearly half of their respective populations. After this, both parties agreed to sign the Antarctic Treaty which, among other things, forbade the use of weapons of mass destruction.",

This period of initial slaughter became known as the One Week Battle or One Week War. It was during this time that Side 6 declared its neutrality in the conflict. The peak of the One Week Battle was \"Operation British\", which took place on January 10, UC 0079. Zeon forces used the depopulated colony cylinder Side 2, Bunch 8 (\"Isle Iffish\") in an attempt to destroy the Earth Federation Forces main headquarters, Jaburo. Though the Earth Federation Space Forces dispatched a fleet of their surviving warships, and even made at least a nuclear strike, in an attempt to stop the operation, the Zeon military successfully defended the colony, and the EFSF was forced to withdraw after taking near-total losses. Upon entering the atmosphere, however, Isle Iffish broke apart, missing Jaburo but causing widespread destruction across Earth. The largest remaining piece of the colony, consisting of approximately the entire front half, hit Sydney, Australia, completely wiping out the city and causing massive damage across the entire continent.

Beginning as an attempt to drop a second colony, the operation quickly turned into a full-scale fleet battle when the majority of the surviving Earth Federation Space Forces, commanded by General Revil, counterattacked. Zeon used nuclear weapons in this battle, causing horrific loss of life not only among the combatants, but resulting in the complete destruction of Side 5 as well. The Earth Federation managed to halt the attempted colony drop and inflict significant losses on the Zeon forces but they were unable to prevent the destruction of Side 5. While the EFSF were able to evacuate a few million Side 5 inhabitants before the battle began, in the end, their forces were annihilated during the battle. The Battle of Loum marked the first time that mobile suits showed their true potential in combat, proving to be terrifyingly effective against the Earth Federation fleet. General Revil was captured by the Black Tri-Stars and several other Zeon pilots (most notably {character}, Shin Matsunaga, and Johnny Ridden) first made a name for themselves as mobile suit aces.  The Federation's losses were heavy. Over 80% of its deployed forces was lost, with only 42 vessels surviving the battle. Meanwhile, the Zeon fleet sustained far less damage thanks to the deployment of mobile suits, losing only 8 battleships and cruisers, with another 16 heavily damaged and 14 moderately damaged.",

The second and third groups were dropped on both coasts of North America with two objectives: 1) to subjugate the Federation's industrial military complex. 2) To take over the Federation food supply. The California Base (a generic term for the more than 20 military bases along the west coast) became the staging ground for subsequent terrestrial assaults. As the bases were captured without damage, they were soon converted to production of Zeon MS. The fourth group, aided by support troops already on Earth, occupied many islands of the Oceania region for the procurement of resources. Up until then, the Principality faced a distinct disadvantage in resource availability, having to rely on Lunar and asteroid mining. The fifth and final group landed in the largely unprotected deserts of North Africa. With facilities, food, and resources at their disposal, the Principality was set for global conquest. From these drop locations, the Zeon army spread across the planet, using captured facilities and material (notably including the Earth Federation's massive California Base) to strengthen their military power. Within a few months, Zeon controlled most of Europe, Asia, and North America. With the Federation forces scattered and their numbers decimated, their outlook was grim though the efforts of special units like the Semovente Corps and anti-mobile suit special tactical squads helped stem the tide on Earth",

The operation was launched on November 7, ending two days later in victory for the Earth Federation. This was remarkable for the fact that the Earth Federation Forces consisted almost entirely of conventional troops, tanks, and aircraft, yet managed to defeat a Zeon force consisting of many mobile suits. The Earth Federation did deploy a small number of mobile suits, but they were mainly used in mop-up operations and contributed relatively little to the battle. Operation Odessa marked the turning point of the One Year War; the beginning of the end for Zeon's forces in Europe and Asia. However, the leader of the Zeon mining operations, Colonel M'Quve, had enough mining material sent to the Zeon homeland to allow the Principality to continue the war without the danger of supply shortages. This battle was the largest and the bloodiest on Earth, where the Earth Federation relied heavily on conventional weapons such as tanks, bombers, fighter craft, a small number of MSs (30 units), and a large number of troops (3,700,000) compared to the smaller but much better equipped Principality of Zeon army; who fielded only a relatively small amount of fighters, bombers, tanks, and artillery, but over a hundred MSs which were more advantageous.",

Sending their new fleets into space, the EFSF moved towards the Zeon homeland at L2. Standing in their way was the Zeon defensive line, consisting of the asteroid space fortresses Solomon and A Baoa Qu, as well as the lunar city Granada. On December 24, UC 0079, the EFSF fleet launched an attack on the asteroid base Solomon, the headquarters of Zeon's Space Attack Force. Using their Solar System, the Earth Federation inflicted heavy damage on the enemy fortress and was able to take Solomon. When it was clear that the battle was lost, Zeon Space Attack Force's Vice Admiral Dozle Zabi gave the order to evacuate the base and sortied in the Big Zam to fight a delaying action. He succeeded in allowing many Zeon forces to retreat, but was killed by Amuro Ray in the process. The capture of Solomon marks the end of Operation Cemballo, and this event is also known as the \"Battle of Solomon\".",

The area of space surrounding the asteroid is known as the \"Sea of Solomon\", giving the fortress its name. The asteroid itself resembles a 6-pointed star polyhedron or an octahedron in general shape, with most viewpoints of it having the silhouette of a four-pointed star. This shape could sometimes be interpreted as being able to defend against attacks from the front, rear, right, left, top, or bottom, the endpoints of the asteroid corresponding to the vertices of an octahedron.\nSolomon was one of the Principality of Zeon's asteroid fortresses, serving as the frontline base of Dozle Zabi's Space Attack Force. It is from here that Zeon launched its first attacks against the Earth Federation during the opening days of the One Year War. From this strategic base, the Principality's space fleets carried out numerous sorties against the Earth Federation Space Force. As such, it became a priority target for the Earth Federation as the war began to shift back into the Federation's favour.\nAfter the battle, Solomon was used as a staging area for the EFSF's invasion of the Principality of Zeon's home territory and was renamed Confeito. As the war came to a close, Confeito remained a base for the Earth Federation and in U.C. 0083, was the chosen site of a full-scale naval review. This made it the main target for the Delaz Fleet during Operation Stardust. Zeon ace Anavel Gato used the RX-78GP02A Gundam \"Physalis\" to attack the naval review at Confeito with an MK-82 nuclear warhead, destroying or crippling two-thirds of the Federation's naval forces that took part in it.\nDespite the damage sustained, the asteroid continued to be a prominent military base used by the Earth Federation. During the Gryps War the base was operated by the Titans, and used to develop the RX-121 Gundam TR-1 ［Hazel］.",

                    "content": "A Baoa Qu was the Principality of Zeon's largest and most powerful asteroid base. Much like Luna Two and Solomon, it was originally transported from the asteroid belt for mining and resource extraction, but it was captured and transformed into a military base by Zeon forces, with the space fortification work completed within six months time. A Baoa Qu was a fusion of two asteroids into one, shaped like a disc and a weight, forming an umbrella-like shape; its size is about 33.75 km tall and 22.5 km in diameter. At the top-centre of the asteroid stands a lone enormous tower (though small in relative scale to the space rock it is built on), presumably where Zeon's elite would reside and observe over the battlefield. A Baoa Qu was built in the opposite L2 point orbit, placing it directly opposite from the Zeon homeland in Side 3. The asteroid provided rear defence, while the Solomon space fortress served as a frontline base. The space fortress served as the Zeon Military Force's general headquarters for their space fleet. It also was used as a mobile weapons production factory. It was the scene of the titanic Battle of A Baoa Qu, one of the greatest battles of the One Year War. Unlike the earlier battle of Solomon, it was a hard-fought victory for the Federation.\nAfter the One Year War, A Baoa Qu was kept by the Republic of Zeon following the signing of the Granada Treaty. Later, in June U.C. 0087, the Republic of Zeon would hand it over to the Earth Federation's Titans special force, who would rename it Gate of Zedan. On 18 January U.C. 0088, Axis Zeon, led by Haman Karn, rammed the Gate of Zedan with their own mobile asteroid base Axis, as a part of the negotiations dealt with the AEUG. The event caused the Gate of Zedan to split and shatter, utterly destroying the asteroid. The Titans were shocked by such sudden betrayal, not to mention how much the Titans lost, including the murder of their leaders, Jamitov Hymen and Bask Om. Afterwards, the Gryps 2 colony laser was seized by Axis, and seized again in turn on 6 February, by the AEUG.",

They are equipped with three massive double-barreled mega particle cannon turrets mounted on their topside. They also have ten smaller double-barreled mega particle cannon turrets, similar to the ones used by the Musai class light cruisers, and finally they have a high number of 155mm double-barreled anti-aircraft machine guns. It has been stated that the Gwazine-class is capable of traveling the distances between the Earth and the asteroid belt, propelled by two primary thrusters and six secondary thrusters. Each of these ships possess hangers large enough to hold up to twenty mobile suits, more than triple what the Federation's Pegasus-class ships can hold. These mobile suits were carried in a large cargo bay underneath the vessel. On the other hand, the Gwazine-class have a few drawbacks. The ships are large and resource-consuming enough that only a handful would be constructed before and during the war.

It was propelled by four thermonuclear rocket engines installed at the end of the two nacelle columns extending to the lower left and right of the bridge. Directly below the bridge is a MS deck that can carry four mobile suits, and it is possible to deliver goods directly by conveyor pipe from the Papua-class supply ship using three supply hatches on each side. The lower part of the bow is equipped with an atmospheric entry capsule \"Komusai\", which is capable of storing supplies, additional personnel, or two mobile suits, adding some logistical flexibility to the ship. The capsule can be launched directly from the Musai and doesn’t require separation prior to ignition, unlike its Federation counterparts. It’s unknown if the Komusai is able to directly reconnect with its mothership upon return. However, any onboard mobile suits can be deployed only after the Komusai has separated, as the capsule's storage hatch is blocked when attached to the Musai. Ships of the class are also capable of launching HLV craft, carried behind the ship between the engines. The cruising range of these ships can be further improved with the optional addition of two large propellant tanks behind the ship. In combat, after fielding its mobile suits, the Musai would engage enemy ships with powerful double-barreled mega particle cannons that could penetrate the armor of any Earth Federation's warships. Other weapons of the ship include a pair of large missile launchers and 10 small missile launchers.",

Like its predecessor, the MS-05B's power transmission pipes were all fixed and contained inside its armor. However, as the B Type saw wider deployment than the A Type, the flaws of this design quickly became apparent: since the power pipes took up most of its internal space, it was very difficult to improve its generator output or swap out parts. The structures of its limbs were also very complex due to the internalized power system. These problems would later be addressed by the MS-06 Zaku II series.

The thrusters were also improved to give the Zaku II better mobility than the Zaku I. Finally, the Zaku II received improvements to its sensor package and has a more powerful thermonuclear reactor. To simplify production the A-type Zaku II used the same armaments of the Zaku I, which consisted of the initial Zaku-type machine gun and a front insertion bazooka. At the time of its deployment the Zaku heat hawk was still in development. Because the Principality's brass did not foresee the Zaku being used in close combat situations, and the fact that the nuclear-weapon using C-type was in production, the A-type was never equipped with a heat hawk.

Compared to the MS-06C Zaku II Early Production Type, the MS-06F removed the heavy anti-nuclear protections, reducing its armor weight and improving its mobility. It was also refitted with a more powerful generator: the MYFG-M-ES series fusion reactor, jointly developed by \"Zeonic\" and \"M&Y Company\". Otherwise, it was not significantly different from its predecessors, the MS-06A and the MS-06C. There existed subtle differences among the F-Type, depending on the time of manufacture and the originating factory. Prior to the introduction of the MS-06S Zaku II Commander Type, MS-06F piloted by squadron leaders were equipped with a head-mounted blade antenna.\nThe MS-06F could run at a speed of 85 km/h, leap 100m into the air with the use of its thrusters, and lift around 80-90t of weight with one hand. Its thrusters had a thrust of 45 tons. Though its punch had a force of 560t, doing so risked severely damaging its manipulators. Instead it more frequently used the spike armor on its left shoulder for shoulder tackle, which had a force of 4,500t.",

Compared to the F Type, the S Type's vernier nozzles were enlarged, and the output of its main thrusters were increased by 30% while retaining the same size. To make space for the improved thrusters and enlarged propellant tanks, various automatic control systems of the F Type were removed. While this reduced S Type's operability, it also enabled experienced pilots to disable many unnecessary limiters and push the mobile suit to its structural limit. Other changes from the F Type included the S Type's generator being 5% lighter, and its armor composition and structure were improved, improving its overall power-weight ratio. Finally, the S Type were all equipped with a head-mounted multi-blade antenna. Though the antenna itself was identical to those found on the F Type, the structure at its base was different, giving it improved communications and enemy detection capabilities. Despite having many special internal components, the S Type still shared 80-90% of its parts with the F Type, making it easy to resupply and maintain. This also meant that like the F Type, it could easily be modified to operate in space or under gravity.",

It removed any space-use equipment that would have become dead weight under gravity, reduced the oxidizer in the propellant, and adopted an air cooling system, leading to a completely different basic structure around its reactor. Due to the removal of unnecessary equipment, it was lighter compared to the F-type, leading to less power loss under gravity. To account for atmospheric distortion, the light receptor semiconductor unit and measurement software of its monoeye were both updated from the ones used by the F-type, and it featured a more accurate infrared sensor. Its manipulators were coated with soft material for improved sealing, with a new software installed to account for the constant 1G gravity. The F-type's AMBAC system was omitted, and the space used for leg sub-thrusters were used to mount newly designed anti-ground sensors. A pair of hardpoints that also serve as I/O ports were added to its legs. However, the sub-thrusters at the bottom of its feet were untouched, as they could improve mobility when used in conjunction with the main thrusters. The J-type mostly used the same weapons as the F-type. However, due to recoil being less problematic under gravity, it was able to equip various optional equipment, including leg-mounted missile pods, the Magella Top cannon, and cracker grenades.",

Thus, the R-2 has higher performance and is lighter than the R-1 and the R-1A Types. The R-2 was reputed as a “Gelgoog wearing a Zaku’s skin” for its high capabilities. In fact, it used parts meant for the still in development Gelgoog in its construction. A result of this is that its legs’ internal structure has been redesigned. The R-2’s legs are also better armored compared to previous Zaku High Mobility Types, offering better protection against enemies attacks. These added armor also make the silhouette of the R-2’s legs more similar to that of the Gelgoog’s.

In addition, based on the results of the renovation of the MS-06F-2 Zaku II F2 Type, the shape and materials of the armor and the balance of the machine were more thoroughly reviewed, resulting in an appearance that is quite different from the previous Zaku II F-Type.\nThe most significant modification was to the cockpit, which is said to have been so good that even new recruits with insufficient training could handle it. In addition, the apogee motors in various parts of the fuselage and the thrusters in the backpack were increased and made larger, and the total thrust was increased by 70 percent compared to the previous F-Type model. On the other hand, the total amount of propellant had not changed, and the time limit at maximum combat thrust has dropped by half. The armor has also been considerably strengthened and the armament has been redesigned, so it does not lag behind the Federation's GM and has achieved considerable high performance. Rolled out one month before the end of the war, this machine is the final production model of the Zaku in the One Year War, but the number produced was small.

It was fitted with thermonuclear jets and rockets under its feet, allowing it to quickly move across the ground, greatly improving its mobility compared to previous ground-use mobile suits. Thanks to sensors located in front of its feet, it was able to traverse uneven terrain. While in cruising mode, it could hover across the ground using only its thermonuclear jets. The Dom can hover at a maximum speed of 381 km/hr for up to 5 hours.\nIts primary thrusters adopted the Saturn Engine, a type of thermonuclear engine that used heavy elements such as zinc and lead as propellant, granting it higher thrust than thermonuclear engines that used lighter elements as propellant. For defense, the Dom was heavily protected, adopting a unique \"skirt armor\" design to protect weak points in the back, such as thrusters. Its cockpit hatch armor, which was its greatest weakness in the front, was also greatly enhanced. However, since the cockpit was entered directly from the front of the Dom, pilots in desert and wetland areas complained that the console panel would become dirty from entering and exiting. Meanwhile, the Dom's head was merged into its chest, a design intended to deflect and ricochet enemy projectiles, as well as lowering the possibility of being hit.",

In addition, it was equipped with more vernier thrusters for increased mobility, and a pair of propellant tanks for increased operating time. Technology from the MS-14 Gelgoog was also incorporated into its design. Compared to its predecessor, its production was simplified, and its durability was enhanced.

To that end, it was intended to achieve the following:\nThe standardization of hand manipulators, allowing the interchangeable use of handheld weapons (with the exception of beam weapons).\nThe standardization of parts, allowing parts sharing among different models.\nThe standardization of cockpits, shortening the pilot training time needed for switching to a different model.\nThese measures were intended to improve Zeon mobile suits' ease of production and maintenance. They would also contribute to speeding up the development of future mobile suits. The plan began in February, U.C. 0079, as the signing of the Antarctic Treaty signified the beginning of a prolonged war. It was completed four months later, in June, U.C. 0079. Thanks to the implementation of the UMP, Zeon's mobile suit production and maintenance efficiency were significantly increased and the development time of future mobile suits was shortened. In addition, thanks to the adoption of the Second Phase Production Type cockpit, the pilot training time for switching to different mobile suit models was reduced, though amphibious mobile suits adopted a different model of standardized cockpit due to their unique needs for durability and temperature control functions.",

Increasing the reactor output would require better cooling capacity, and the most efficient method was water cooling. Therefore, in November U.C. 0078, MIP and Zimmad received orders to develop amphibious MS which can use seawater for cooling. In addition to the use of mega particle weapons, the amphibious MS can reach its destination by traveling through the sea on its own, allowing it to fight in areas away from Zeon's frontline bases. To reduce water resistance, the Gogg's head became a rounded streamline shape, the MS' equipment was internalized, and the limbs can be retracted when cruising underwater. The Gogg has long operating time in water, and relies on thermonuclear hydrojet engines that draw in water, then heat them with the high heat of the reactor to create thrust. When operating on land, cooling water is stored in internal ballast tank, and the mobile suit's operating time is limited to 1–2 hours. This shortened operating time on land is due to reactor cooling limitations. The Gogg is not an agile machine due to its weight, but its pressure-resistant design provides sufficient defense in close combat.",

Numerous disadvantages surfaced during operation on the battlefield, such as lack of flexibility due to the Gouf's fixed armament. The Gouf would be completely redesigned as the MS-07B-3, which was an improvement over the original. The Gouf Custom was designed with improved close quarters shooting and detachable weapons. It was designed primarily for ace pilots preferring a lighter mobile suit that could leap and jump as opposed to the heavy, yet effective MS-09B Dom. The Gouf Custom featured multiple changes to the MS-07B, including the elimination of the awkward five finger 75mm machine guns, replacing it with a normal manipulator and a wrist mounted 3-barrel 35mm Machine gun. The coil-like heat rod is replaced with a magnetic grappler wire that connects and disables an enemy with an electric charge rather than damaging them. The grappler wire could also be used as a repelling line that could slow or even halt the descent of a falling Gouf in the right conditions. The shield of the Gouf was modified so that it not only stored the Gouf's heat sword but is also capable of carrying a 75mm gatling gun, greatly enhancing the mobile suit's fire power.",

Developed in the captured Earth Federation California Base, the MS-06D Zaku Desert Type, also known as the D-Type, was designed for Earth's desert and tropical regions. Early test units used a double antennae, but when Zeon finalized the mobile suit for mass production, they dropped it down to a single antenna. They also repainted the Zakus to a more sand-like color. The Zaku Desert Type featured several new features for its adaptation to the new climates. The biggest change was the replacement of the Zaku II's standard thruster jetpack with a heat-dissipating radiator backpack. The D-Type was thus fitted with jet thrusters in the legs and skirt armor so that it had a small boost in mobility.",

Across its torso was an array of anti-air mega particle cannons, which were used to prevent mobile suits from approaching. The claws on its legs could be fired as missiles. For protection, it was equipped with a barrier that nullified beam weapons. In order to power all of its beam weapons at the same time, the Big Zam was equipped with four large fusion reactors, each with a power output of 35,000 kilowatt. Due to issues with cooling, it was only able to operate at full combat capability for less than 20 minutes.

Of these twenty-four units, nine were configured into the MS-14B Gelgoog High Mobility Type while the rest were outfitted as Gelgoog Cannons. The Gelgoog Cannon is equipped with a specialized head unit and mounts a powerful beam cannon on a modified B-type backpack, and even with it, the suit's reactor is still powerful enough to support other weapons systems. This meant the Gelgoog Cannon could carry beam rifles and bazookas, or even swap out the forearm jet engines to mount other optional equipment. As the Gelgoog Cannon made use of the B-type's powerful backpack, it had enough thrust to keep itself maneuverable despite the added weaponry. The suit soon proved itself a capable fire-support and anti-fleet unit.",

It was designed with the United Maintenance Plan (UMP) in mind, greatly increasing its specifications and ease of piloting, as well as simplifying its manufacturing process and improving the interchangeability of its parts with other models. The Gelgoog Jäger was equipped with a total of 24 posture control sub-thrusters in addition to the main thrusters, significantly improving its mobility in space. Due to its nature as a sniper unit, its monoeye has a larger field of vision than standard units. In addition, since it was designed as a commander unit, it was equipped with a head-mounted blade antenna by default for enhanced communications. Similarly, its backpack had another antenna and a laser communication unit. The Gelgoog Jäger's primary weapon was a large-sized beam machine gun, which could either fire pulsed beam pellets or a single-shot long-range beam. It was able to use this weapon thanks to a tuned up, new model generator. The beam machine gun's low rate of beam deterioration, combined with its exceptionally accurate scope and the Jäger's latest fire control hardware and software, granted it unparalleled firing accuracy.",

To address these shortcomings, the Hygogg was developed. Introduced at the end of the One Year War, this machine was designed from scratch and retained only its predecessor's basic concepts. The result was a smaller, lighter, compact, and more powerful machine equipped with an improved generator and better weaponry. Its agility and mobility in water and on land were also enhanced. Additionally, production costs were reduced due to the implementation of standardized parts, including the cockpit, derived from the United Maintenance Plan, which greatly enhanced repairs and servicing. The Hygogg's shoulder armor can flip down and its arms can be retracted to assume a streamlined form for improved underwater cruising, while an optional jet pack can be mounted on the back for short aerial mobility. Weapon wise, a pair of 120mm machine cannons are mounted in the waist, four torpedo launchers in the head, vice claws in the forearm, and its primary weapon is a pair of hand-mounted beam cannons similar to the Z'Gok series, allowing for better ranged attack.",

It was designed with exceptional close combat ability in anticipation of melee combat against the Earth Federation Forces' mobile suits. However, its focus on close combat resulted in lower versatility. Ultimately, Zeonic's MS-14 Gelgoog was selected as the second phase mainstay mobile suit due to its superior general performance and versatility, though the Gyan's basic performance was said to be superior to the Gelgoog. Though the Gyan's reactor output was not sufficient for a beam rifle, it was more than enough to power its primary weapon, a custom beam saber. Its only other weapon was the missile shield, an equipment that combined offensive and defensive capabilities. Thanks to its use of the fluid pulse accelerator, as well as its arms and hands being tuned specifically for close combat, the Gyan's responsiveness and range of motion were extremely high among One Year War-era mobile suits. A Gyan was customized for use by Colonel M'Quve of the Mobile Assault Force. The appearance of the Gyan, with its silver armor and Pickelhaube helmet design, had a strong resemblance to a medieval armored knight.

The Kämpfer was a very focused design, never intended to work outside of its role. Within this role it was an exceptional unit, rivaling the Federation's RX series in firepower and speed. It was equipped with numerous thrusters and verniers to achieve high maneuverability. Conversely, the large number of thrusters resulted in higher fuel consumption rate, limiting its operational time. The Kämpfer's design opted for minimal armor, even removing the hip-mounted skirt armor found on most mobile suits. The choice of conventional shell-based weapons rather than beam weapons was made to reduce the drain on its reactor and resultant drop in speed. Weapon racks were designed to be ejected from the unit as they were expended, minimizing dead weight.

Those beam sabers could be extended into a spear-like beam javelin, which could be used to stab into an enemy from a longer distance. The Gundam also used more conventional weaponry; it could launch rockets with a \"Hyper Bazooka\", the Federation's answer to the bazookas used by Zeon's Zakus; in addition, its head was outfitted with a pair of small vulcan guns, as a way of attacking light-armored aircraft and vehicles without wasting ammo or energy from its more powerful armaments. Lastly, it wielded a shield which would offer it a defense against enemy attacks that not even its Luna Titanium body could withstand without damage.

It has a maximum acceleration of 0.94 Gs in space, which is better than the Gundam's and roughly twice of the Zaku's. The armor of the GM uses Titanium Alloy. Although titanium alloy is less durable than Luna Titanium, it is also slightly lighter which reduces the GM's overall mass. The GM was primarily armed with a beam spray gun, a less powerful version of the Gundam's beam rifle but could still destroy MS in one shot. Early in production, the beam spray gun had yet to be mass-produced so most GMs were equipped with various machine guns. These machine guns continued to be used by the GMs later, and the machine could also use the Gundam's beam rifle when required. It could also use a mass production version of the Gundam's Hyper Bazooka for heavier firepower. For close combat, the GM has a beam saber, and a shield similar to the one used by the Gundam.

A middle-range support mobile suit developed simultaneously with the RX-78 Gundam and the RX-75 Guntank as part of Operation V. Due to its role as an artillery support unit, the Guncannon's design prioritized durability over mobility, and it was not equipped with any melee weapons. However, its armor was particularly heavy, capable of surviving a direct hit from a bazooka. Similar to the Guntank, the Guncannon's main weapons were a pair of shell-firing cannons, chosen for their reliability over beam weapons. These cannons could be optionally swapped out for a pair of spray missile launchers. The Guncannon's generator output allowed it to equip a beam rifle. It was also equipped with a pair of head-mounted vulcan guns and hand grenades for attacking enemy strongholds. The fire control of the Guncannon was primarily handled by the sensor array and coprocessor system in the head. However, the shoulder-mounted cannons incorporated data from the circular sensor on its crotch, and were capable of autonomously tracking and locking onto targets to a certain extent, independent of the pilot's control. While the Guncannon's mobility was adversely affected by its weight, the backpack thrusters have sufficient thrust to enable jumping maneuvers under gravity for a short period of time.",

However, it was said to be closer to a tank rather than a mobile suit. A number of companies such as Takim and Hervic participated in its development. The Guntank had the torso and arms of a mobile suit, but possessed caterpillar treads for legs. Initially, it was designed to be piloted by a crew of two, with a gunner in the canopy-style cockpit on the head and a driver in another cockpit in the torso. However, it was later changed to be controlled by a single pilot in the canopy-style cockpit. Its reactor is a hybrid type of nuclear reactors and gas turbines, and its output is insufficient for powering beam weapons. The Guntank's main weapons are twin 120mm cannons, which are effective at long and medium ranges. Its arms have four-barrel missile launchers instead of hands, and they provided good cover fire against enemy tanks and aircraft, but are less effective against enemy mobile suits. A major flaw of the Guntank is its inability to turn its torso, making it difficult to aim the cannons at moving targets, as the Guntank must reposition itself. Another major flaw is that its design was primarily for ground combat, resulting in it having poor maneuverability in space.",

This reactor was \"radical\" due to the fact that it was the first \"clean\" nuclear reactor, emitting zero neutron radiation. The nuclear equation was:\n 2 3 H e + 1 2 H → 2 4 H e + p (energy released: 18.35 MeV)\nThe reactant used a rare isotope of helium known as helium-3 (i.e., 2 protons and 1 neutron in the nucleus). A helium-3 atom is fused with a deuterium atom (heavy hydrogen) to form the stable helium-4 and a single proton. Since the proton is positively charged, it can easily be trapped within a magnetic field. The main practical problem with this reaction is that helium-3 is extremely rare; there are few deposits on Earth, mainly found in uranium mines, and these are mostly depleted. The fusion reactors rely on a constant supply of helium-3 imported from the outer solar system planet Jupiter, thus necessitating the beginning of the Jupiter Energy Fleet. The JEF would travel from Earth to Jupiter, which has a high level of helium-3 in its atmosphere, and then come back to Earth with the gas fuel. It should be noted that in real physics, helium-3-deuterium fusion produces neutrons due to inevitable deuterium-deuterium reactions. Also, significant quantities of helium-3 were recently discovered on the moon, although there is certainly much more on Jupiter.",

Within the next few years, they identified the cause: a new elementary particle generated by the helium-3 reaction on the inner wall of the reactor, which was named the Minovsky particle or \"M\" particle. The Minovsky particle has near-zero rest mass - though, like any particle, its mass increases to reflect its potential or kinetic energy - and can carry either a positive or negative electrical charge. When scattered in open space or in the air, the repulsive forces between charged Minovsky particles cause them to spontaneously align into a regular cubic lattice structure called an I-field. The main use of the Minovsky particle was in combat and communication. When the Minovsky particle is spread in large numbers in the open air or in open space, the particles disrupt low-frequency electromagnetic radiation, such as microwaves and radio waves. The Minovsky particle also interferes with the operations of electronic circuitry and destroys unprotected circuits due to the particles' high electrical charge which act like a continuous electromagnetic pulse on metal objects. Because of the way Minovsky particles react with other types of radiation, radar systems and long-range wireless communication systems become useless, infra-red signals are defracted and their accuracy decreases, and visible light is fogged. This became known as the \"Minovsky Effect\".",

This diffraction and polarization process disrupts the electromagnetic waves. Notice in real life there is a similar experimental particle that could do the same thing in few thousandth of a second, which is still not practical but proves the theory to be correct. A second use of the I-field (and Minovsky particles in general) was the repulsion of charged plasma and chargeless mega-particles from an I-field surface, which was of use both in power generation and armament technology. If controlled, the particles can form fringes of different widths and further interfere with electromagnetic waves of shorter wavelengths. This provides the basis for the miniaturizing of fusion reactors installed in mobile suits since a controlled I-field can block the infra-red waves. This reduces the heat from the thermonuclear reaction and reduces the need for coolant and shielding for the fusion reactors. Without such a field, a pilot would be boiled alive in a few nanoseconds and the suit would burst into superheated gasses, thus explaining many of the series' casualties when the reactor of a mobile suit is pierced with a beam weapon powerful enough to disperse this I-field.",

The Minovsky particles that form the I-field lattice also helped catalyze the fusion reaction, in a process similar to the muon-catalyzed fusion investigated by real-world scientists during the 1950s. This super-efficient design was only a fifth as large as an equivalently powerful Minovsky-Ionesco reactor, allowing the reactor to be mounted within the mobile suit instead of an external backpack. For this reason, it was adopted for use on mobile suits as the standard power plant. Furthermore, Minovsky also developed the Fluid Pulse system, which utlized the Minovsky Particles to drive the Mobile Suit's system, which allows active attitude control possible.

On September 14, U.C.0058, Side 3 declared independence and established the Republic of Zeon. In U.C.0068, Deikun suddenly died of a heart attack during a parliamentary speech.

The Zabi family, having gained power, aimed for independence from the Federation government by force. On January, U.C. 0079, the Zeon War of Independence (One Year War) began.\nWith a lack of command and control, the remaining Zeon fleet went into a panic. Split as to what to do, several ships gathered as many as possible before fleeing the battlefield, while others remained to fight to the last man, each believing that it was what their commanders wanted. With the fall of A Baou Qu, the remaining government of the Principality of Zeon surrendered to the Earth Federation. The war was brought to an end with the signing of the Granada Treaty on January 1, UC 0080.\nWith the Zabi family's reign ended, the remaining citizens of the Principality of Zeon entered negotiations with the Earth Federation. It was replaced by the Republic of Zeon, the colonies of Side 3 formed their nation subject to Federation inspections and review. Maintaining a small defense force comprised of ships and mobile suits from the Principality of Zeon, the Republic of Zeon has taken on a more peaceful relationship with the Earth Federation.\nLoyalists to the Principality of Zeon and the Zabi family did continue, however, as those that escaped capture or death at the Battle of A Baoa Qu either hid within the Earth Sphere or fled to other regions, including the asteroid Axis and Mars. These loyalists later formed their movements based upon the principals of the Principality of Zeon, with one Neo Zeon movement being led by the daughter of Admiral Maharaja Karn, Haman Karn. She used Dozle Zabi's daughter Mineva Lao Zabi as a figurehead and rallying point for the movement.",

The inauguration of the Earth Federation's charter marked the beginning of the Universal Century calendar system with the year 0001 U.C., but this event was marred by a terrorist attack on Laplace, a space station that had been built as the official residence of the Earth Federation Prime Minister. Laplace was destroyed, and the first elected prime minister, Ricardo Marcenas, perished.  In order to relieve Earth of the burden and allow it to heal, the Earth Federation announced the Space Colonization Plan. The Earth Federation began the construction of orbital habitats, based on the designs and research of Gerard K. O'Neill, and located in the Earth-Lunar Lagrangian Points. The colonies, called Bunches (possibly due to the ballistic pairing of the colony cylinders) were then organized into administrative sectors called Sides. While most of the human population was forced to relocate to the colonies as part of the Space Colonization Plan, the wealthy and influential members were able to remain on Earth. This gave rise to the image of the Earth Federation as \"Earth-Born Elite\", living comfortably on Earth while the ordinary populace, for the most part, has been forced to live in space.",

Like the Earth Federation, the origin of the Earth Federation Forces predates the Universal Century. By some accounts, it was formed from the United Nations Forces in A.D. 2009.[1] Compared to the former United Nations Forces, the EFF was given far more power, allowing the Earth Federation government to respond to regional conflicts and natural disasters far more efficiently. The deployment of EFF to regional conflicts continued into the Universal Century. However, after the Earth Federation declared the eradication of conflicts on Earth in U.C. 0022, these conflicts began reducing in scale. In response, the Earth Federation Forces began a gradual reduction of armaments. At this point, the EFF was made up of only three branches: Ground Force, Navy and Air Force. Even as space colonization expanded the Federation's territory into space, the EFF did not create a space force. By the U.C. 0040s, however, Spacenoids - second generation space immigrants - began increasingly demanding autonomy. In response, the Federation government founded the Earth Federation Space Force (EFSF) in the U.C. 0050s. In U.C. 0058, in response to Side 3's declaration of independence as the Republic of Zeon, the EFF initiated the 0060s Military Armament Enhancement Plan, a plan to reorganize the entire EFF with the Space Force at its center.",

With Minovsky Particles restricting combat to within visual range, the EFGF's main battle tank, the Type 61 Tank quickly proved unable to match Zeon's mobile suits, with its advanced data link system and electronics rendered ineffective. As the development of mobile suits was difficult in the short term, the EFGF developed a stop-gap measure: the M-101A3 Regina, an Anti-Mobile Suit Missile (AMSM) designed to be carried and used by specialist squads known as Anti-MS Squads. Though their casualty rates were high, they were able to buy valuable time for friendly units to retreat and regroup. The EFGF began development of the RX-79［G］ Gundam Ground Type, with the EFGF leading the development. The Gundam Ground Type was constructed in very limited numbers and deployed to regions close to Zeon territory in order to check their aggression. Later, the RGM-79［G］ GM Ground Type, a simplified version of the Gundam Ground Type, was also developed. In July, U.C. 0079, the Earth Federation Forces Far Eastern Army created the 1st Mechanized Composite Battalion (commonly known as \"Kojima Batallion\"), its first mobile suit-equipped battalion.",

Due to Zeon's swift attack, Federation forces were not able to destroy them in time, and all of them were captured, allowing Zeon to form its own submarine fleets. Since the EFF prioritized the production of spaceships, the navy was slow to replenish its strength. Due to the persistent threat of Zeon submarine fleets, its main focus was anti-submarine warfare, with Himalaya-class anti-sub light aircraft carriers and Don Escargot anti-sub attack craft continuously in production. However, their numbers were too few, and Zeon retained command of the sea for most of the war. In order to counter Zeon's aquatic mobile suits, the Federation developed the RAG-79 Aqua GM.

During Zeon's first landing operation in February, U.C. 0079, the Federation Air Force scrambled to intercept Zeon HLVs. However, since Zeon's space fleet dispersed Minovsky Particles at maximum density in the orbit, guided missiles were rendered unusable, and high-altitude fighters were unable to correctly predict the trajectories of the HLVs and only 32 were shot down. The Federation believed that Zeon's air force would not be a threat to their own. However, due to the use of Minovsky Particles, aerial battles devolved back into WWII-era dog fights, allowing even Zeon's Dopp fighters to fight on equal footing with the Federation's fighters. Meanwhile, many of the Federation Air Force's weapons were rendered useless: the AF-01 Mongoose, a ground attack plane designed for destroying stationary targets and tanks, proved ineffective against the agile mobile suits; the Dish, an AWACS aircraft, was of limited use under Minovsky Particle interference and was relegated to being a VIP transport.",

He has regularly proven himself in unfavourable situations, such as his early command of White Base during the One Year War.\nEight years after the One Year War ended, Bright, like most of his comrades aboard White Base, was alienated by the High Command of the Earth Federation Space Forces. He was promoted to Commander and assigned to captain the shuttle spacecraft Temptation, whose primary missions were to escort high-ranking Earth Federation officials.\nBright defected to the AEUG to aid their struggle against the Titans after being personally assaulted by Titans officers, including Bask Om himself, when he objected to a set of unethical orders. Considering his veteran experience in mobile suit warfare as the captain of White Base during the One Year War, the AEUG commissions Bright with the rank of Captain and gives him command of the assault space carrier Argama, the flagship and crown jewel of the AEUG fleet.[2]\nBright Noa worked together with his former adversary, {character}, and together they formed the core leadership of the Argama.

Although he was a full-fledged soldier, he was ostensibly the manager of Macdaniel's, a hamburger store in the lunar city of Amman. As the captain of the Argama, Henken commanded the ship during several missions, including the capture of the RX-178 Gundam Mk-II from the Titan headquarters Gryps. He quickly grew attracted to Titans pilot-turned-AEUG pilot Emma Sheen, who refused his advances. Following the rescue of a Temptation-class space shuttle, Henken was replaced as captain of the Argama by the Temptation's captain Bright Noa. Henken went on to captain the Radish, a new battleship in the AEUG fleet.\nOn February 21, 0088, during the final battle for Gryps II, Henken ordered the Radish to support Emma, who was engaged in a battle against Yazan Gable in his RX-139 Hambrabi.

He reprimanded Scirocco for failing to show up at the Gate of Zedan when it was being destroyed, but didn't go any further than that, even though he still didn't trust Scirocco. During the conference, Scirocco said he agreed with Haman about how people \"whose souls are weighed down by Earth's gravity\" were hardly fit to lead in outer space, irking Jamitov despite his claims of loyalty. Scirocco pulled a gun on Haman, but Char shot him first, grazing his arm. Sensing the danger, Sarah Zabiarov blasted through the conference room with her Bolinoak Sammahn, sending everything into disarray. Jamitov and Scirocco were the only two people left in the remains of the conference room. Scirocco confidently took this opportunity to kill Jamitov and blamed Haman for it.",

At some point she met Amuro Ray, describing him later as being somewhat distant.\nShe, along with former squadmate Jerid Messa and then shuttle captain Bright Noa witnessed Kamille Bidan's theft of a prototype Gundam Mk-II from a secret facility on Green Noah space colony. This Gundam Mk-II and a second one were appropriated by AEUG. Emma was also there to witness the abusive treatment of Bright Noa by Bask Om and Jamaican Daninghan.\nEmma was ordered by Bask to fly her Gundam MK-II (the only remaining of the three that hasn't been stolen), to Argama under the intention of a truce. There, she was to deliver a message to AEUG leader Blex Forer. It became evident to Blex that Emma was totally unaware of the nature of the message, hence her seeming lack of concern. The AEUG was to surrender the stolen Gundam prototypes or they would kill a hostage. This hostage turned out to be Kamille Bidan's mother Hilda whom he tried to rescue, only to fail when Jerid Messa, under mission orders, destroyed the space capsule in which she was imprisoned. The Titans subsequently detained Kamille and reunited with his father Franklin Bidan, also being held hostage.\nEmma chose an opportunity to break Kamille and Franklin out of detainment, disguise them as pilots, and stole the three Gundam Mk-II units. They returned to Argama and Emma announced her wish to defect. Although {character} suspected that she might not be a true Titan, he, along with the rest of the crew, were nevertheless suspicious. Emma was placed on provisional status but it didn't take long for her to prove herself in the eyes of the Argama crew.\nEmma was later pitted in a duel with former AEUG friend, Reccoa Londe, who defected to join Paptimus Scirocco on the side of the Titans. In the ensuing duel, Emma managed to stab Reccoa's Pallas Athene with Mk-II's beam saber, disabling it. After abandoning her heavily damaged mobile suit to check on Reccoa, Yazan attacked yet again. This time, he fired on the ruined Pallas Athene, destroying it and killing Reccoa, if she wasn't already dead. Emma was caught in the explosion and fatally injured by shrapnel. Emma was soon retrieved by Kamille, but she died in his arms on an abandoned Alexandria-class cruiser. Emma's body would be destroyed when Gryps 2's Colony Laser would fire upon the Titans fleet while her unit was recovered by Fa.",

This is offset by his youthful feminine face, which is most frequently shown either stern or scowling, a disposition inherited from his father. He has blue hair inherited from his mother, cut short with curls in back. He is typically seen wearing a light-blue AEUG jumpsuit, and he wore a specialized normal suit when piloting Mobile Suits.\nHe tends to be brash, thoughtless, somewhat self-important, and prone to acting on his own judgment, in addition to being arrogant in his own right. This leads to him getting more than his fair share of abuse, both mental and physical.\nAs the final battle between the AEUG and the Titans approached its fateful conclusion in the Battle of Gryps, Kamille began tapping into the mysterious \"Bio-Sensor\" in the Zeta Gundam as his Newtype abilities grew, thus unleashing a power never before seen when he destroyed Yazan Gable's Hambrabi. Kamille's anger triggered the Bio-Sensor, which in turn enshrouds the Zeta in a purple glow of power. Kamille used this power to extend the length of the Zeta Gundam's beam saber then sliced Yazan's Hambrabi in two, although Yazan was able to eject in the suit's escape pod. In his final battle with Scirocco, Kamille proved to have the stronger mind (having gained the strength of all the people he loved who had died during the war). Despite impaling the Zeta Gundam into Scirocco's PMX-003 The O, a dying Paptimus Scirocco still managed to unleash a mind-crippling blow to Kamille Bidan, leaving him in a delusional psychotic state.",

While technically a part of the Earth Federation Forces, the Titans operated under the sole control of Jamitov Hymen, functioning as his own personal military, and carried out violent actions with impunity, outside the limits of the Federation’s supervision. The Titan ranks were primarily made up of pro-Earthnoid soldiers, most of whom harbored heavy anti-Spacenoid sentiments and were known to use muscle and intimidation tactics to enforce their ranks, even against civilians, fellow Federal soldiers, and lesser Titans officers.\nThe cruelty and oppressive nature of the Titans were eventually exposed when the AEUG captured the Federation capital building in Dakar during a televised assembly of Federation leaders. The Titans attempted to silence {character}, who was making a passionate speech about humanity moving into space before denouncing the Titans, through the use of mobile suits in populated areas of the city with complete disregard for its citizens. Their actions and brutality were caught on camera, which was broadcasted to the entire Earth Sphere, forcing the Earth Federation to publicly acknowledge the monsters they had ultimately created. With both public support and Federation opinion slipping from their hands, the Titans were effectively forced onto the offensive, which resulted in them ironically allying themselves with the recently returned Axis Zeon forces, the very thing they were formed to oppose.\nTowards the end of the Gryps Conflict, the AEUG successfully captured the Titans' Gryps II colony laser, which they used to wipe out the majority of the Titan fleet, with their leadership eventually lost in the ensuing three-way conflict between the AEUG, the Titans and Axis forces.\nAlthough the vast majority of Titans personnel died in the conflict, those who survived the war broke away in several directions. Many returned to the Earth Federation and either resumed military service or were subjected to trials for their war crimes. Other members unwilling to surrender formed rebel groups such as New Desides, but were eventually annihilated by the Earth Federation’s Task Force Alpha in early U.C. 0088. The remaining Titans remnants either joined Axis Zeon in their preparation to invade Earth or fled to Mars seeking sanctuary under the protection of ReZeon, who accepted them under the pretense of bolstering their own ranks despite the Titans’ begrudging attitude.",

Unlike his superior however, Jamaican was not opposed to having spacenoids included in the Titans, believing that such an action may lessen the AEUG's influence in space. Jamaican's smug attitude often causes him to come into conflict with certain other Titans; specifically Paptimus Scirocco and Yazan Gable.\nAssigned to pursue the AEUG flagship Argama after the rebels stage their daring raid on the Titans headquarters, Jamaican took command of the cruiser Alexandria and chased the Argama back and forth across the Earth Sphere. When the AEUG's forces head to Earth to attack Jaburo, he returned to Gryps. Months later, he continued to command the Alexandria during Operation Apollo. After the operation, Jamaican took command of the Titans garrison from Scirocco, and ultimately lost the city during the AEUG's recapture of Von Braun. To rectify his humiliation, Jamaican attempted to drop a colony on Granada, but through the actions of the AEUG, the colony misses its target. After the failed colony drop, he decided to return to Gryps to resupply, but Yazan has other ideas. During the Skirmish at the Gwazine Wreckage, Yazan manipulated AEUG pilot Emma Sheen to fire her Super Gundam's long beam rifle at the Alexandria's bride, killing Jamaican for him.",

It is not clarified if these formations were always part of the asteroid's natural appearance or if mining operations carved them into those shapes, though one can presume so, as there are specific sections around the bottom \"mountains\" where artificial cutouts are clearly made.\nThe Axis base was built by the Principality of Zeon in UC 0072. It was used, like many other asteroids, as a resource mining base. Given its position in the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter, it was also used as a stopping point for the Jupiter Energy Fleet during its trips between Earth and Jupiter. Due to its remote location, Axis did not play a large role in the fighting of the One Year War. However, it remains important to the conflict as a refuge for renegade Zeon soldiers. After the Battle of A Baoa Qu, the Principality of Zeon officially surrendered to the Earth Federation; however, many soldiers in the Zeon military refused to accept this outcome. Some, such as the Delaz Fleet, chose to remain hidden in the Earth Sphere. Most, however, fled the Earth Sphere and traveled to Axis, often with their families and dependents in tow and the influx population grew to 30,000. Many of the people who escaped to Axis were also Zeon engineers, and the development of new mobile weapons and space vessels continued there. At some point, Axis was fitted with large thermonuclear pulse thrusters for propulsion. On February 6, UC 0086, these thrusters were activated, and Axis began to travel toward the Earth Sphere. The trip took nearly two years; twenty months after it began to move, Axis arrived in the Earth Sphere, finding itself in the middle of the Gryps Conflict. Haman Karn used Axis as a mobile base and headquarters for her forces in the battle against both the AEUG and the Titans. At one point in the conflict, Axis itself was used as a weapon, ramming the Titans' base the Gate of Zedan and destroying it, though Axis suffered only minor damage. When Haman Karn declared herself the leader of the First Neo Zeon on UC 0088, she continued to use Axis as a mobile headquarters and base. It was infiltrated several times by the AEUG, specifically Judau Ashta, but continued to be used throughout the conflict. Towards the end of the civil war between Haman and Glemy Toto's forces, Glemy takes control of Axis and uses the asteroid and its satellite, Moussa, to crash into and destroy Haman's colony, Core 3. After Neo Zeon was defeated, the base was abandoned for some time.",

After the death of Jamitov Hymen at the hands of Paptimus Scirocco, Bask stood as the only obstacle preventing the latter from acquiring complete control over the Titans.

                    "content": "A direct descendant of the RX-78-2 Gundam developed by the Titans, the Gundam Mk-II is the first mobile suit to utilize the new movable frame concept. In this new concept, rather than merely serving as a structural framework, the movable frame incorporates all the mobile suit's vital mechanisms, including the actuators and control systems required for movement, and excludes the mobile suit's weapons, armor, and propellant tanks. This approach dramatically improves the mobile suit's responsiveness, reliability, and energy efficiency, as well as making it far more agile than traditional designs. Another characteristic of the Gundam Mk-II is that some of its legs' movable parts are exposed and this design feature is based on the prevailing idea at that time that avoiding being hit by the enemy is the preferable choice. The origin for this idea is because no existing armor can fully protect against beam weaponry, thus it is better to increase the mobile suit's mobility by weight reduction rather than equip more armor which would lead to a higher weight and lower mobility. The mobile suit also has what had become the standard 360-degree panoramic screen and linear seat fitted in a circular cockpit that also functions as an escape pod. The multiple panels of the panoramic screen make up a single 360-degree display, covering the entire inner surface of the cockpit. The image displayed on this screen is a computer simulation constructed from the cameras distributed around the mobile suit's exterior. The viewpoint is that of the mobile suit's head, and the image is carefully edited to remove the mobile suit itself. The linear seat is suspended in the center of the cockpit, supported by a linear arm which electromagnetically counters G-forces and impact shocks in order to protect the pilot. Together, the panoramic screen and the linear seat gives the pilot a larger field of view and eliminates blind spots.",

Londo Bell was first commanded by Bright Noa, with its mobile suit combat squads led by ace pilot Amuro Ray.\nIn the event of a major insurgency such as a Zeon uprising, Londo Bell would respond as the tip of the Federation's spear. However, due to the actions of the late Jamitov Hymen and the Titans during the Gryps war, Londo Bell was given a much lesser degree of autonomy from the main Federation Forces, and as a precaution was barely built to even a tenth of the size of the Titan's numbers during their heyday. Despite these precautions, there were those who would constantly hold Londo Bell in suspicion of trying to follow in the Titans' footsteps.\nIn U.C. 0091, the group fought Titans remnants at Side 1. The Titans remnants deployed the new MRX-013-3 Psycho Gundam Mk-IV G-Doors, but it was swiftly destroyed by veteran ace pilot, Amuro Ray.\nIn U.C. 0093, former Zeon officer/AEUG leader {character} returned, after being missing-in-action following the Gryps War. After occupying the refugee colony Sweetwater without firing a single shot, he publicly declared himself the new leader of Neo Zeon, and shortly thereafter started a new war against the Federation.

However, it was not developed by the Earth Federation Forces' own engineers like most previous RGM series mobile suit. Instead, it was produced and supplied by Anaheim Electronics (AE). Created through combining the Earth Federation Forces' expertise of the GM series with AE's MS development technologies, the Jegan's performance is significantly higher than the RGM-86R GM III. It also has improved productivity due to the use of Titanium Alloy Ceramic Composite armor, as well as high operability, and excellent versatility. All these allows it to become the \"next-generation standard MS\".\nThe Jegan highly exemplified the original concept of MS being \"mobile infantry for melee combat\", and is designed for close combat in and around space colonies. It can also operate under gravity without any modifications. With a backpack containing a single main thruster, two small thrusters at the bottom, and two articulated vernier arms at the top, the Jegan's thrust and acceleration performance could match-high mobility-type machines from the Gryps War-era. Its backpack also featured exchangeable propellant tanks. Also notable are the Vernier's for attitude controls on the front shoulder armor, enlarged centre shoulder armor sections to fit the side thrusters, and a calf-mounted thruster on each leg. The use of lightened armor grants the machine high maneuverability, its front skirt armor is removed to maintain the legs' range of articulation, while its head has a long-range sensor installed in the forehead in addition to the fixed main sensors. The Jegan is armed with mainly short-range weaponry, including a beam saber, a short-range type beam rifle, three hand grenades, a vulcan pod system, and a shield with twin missile launchers.",

It is developed based upon the design of an Axis machine taken out by members of Neo Zeon following the group's defeat at the end of the First Neo Zeon War. Since the resources of Char's Neo Zeon are limited, the Geara Doga was not a particularly high-performing unit when compared to the machines used by Haman Karn's Neo Zeon four years earlier; however, it was well in line with the style of mobile suit design of the day. Its performance was also sufficient for most soldiers, easy to mass-produce and remains a threat for the Earth Federation's own mass-produced suit, the RGM-89 Jegan. \nThe Geara Doga has a wide variety of weapons to cope with different combat situations. Its only fixed armaments are a beam sword-axe for close combat and an shock anchor. It can be equipped with a shield with four grenade launchers and two different types of beam machine guns, with one capable of mounting additional weaponry. The Geara Doga is fitted with old Zeonic-style mono-eye head sensors able to detect targets at a longer range and thus make a faster offensive; however, when within combat range, the sensor's performance becomes limited in terms of target-tracking. The basic specifications of this machine is for space combat, and a backpack for long-distance cruising is standard equipment. With its versatility, maneuverability, and maintainability, the Geara Doga combines all the necessary factors as a practical weapon while earning the trust of mechanics and pilots in the field.",
