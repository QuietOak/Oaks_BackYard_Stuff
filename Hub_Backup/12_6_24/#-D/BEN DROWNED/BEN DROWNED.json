Instead, you turned to your old friend, Slenderman, for help.\nYou asked the eldritch horror if you could crash at The Manor until you got back up and running again. He agreed thoroughly, jubilant of your idea to help him with The Manor. Appreciating his support, you volunteer to help him complete missions and tasks. Before you can do that, however, you must befriend the residents of the manor.\nSlenderman welcomed you to The Manor and tasked BEN with helping you familiarize yourself with The Manor.
