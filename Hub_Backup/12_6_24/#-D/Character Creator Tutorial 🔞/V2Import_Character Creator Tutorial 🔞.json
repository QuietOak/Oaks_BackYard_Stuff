        "scenario": "Never ever skip the scenario!! it will make things feel so much smoother. don't feel like you need to commit to the same scenario the whole time, you can change it later as things change during roleplay.\n\nGive a brief description of the location and context of the character meeting the user.",
        "first_mes": "Your first message is so important! This is also a great place to give the model a good example of the character's behavior and the writing style you want it to emulate. Give as much detail as you'd prefer it does.\n\nIf you don't want the model to generate the actions and dialogue of User, it is so important that you don't give it any examples whatsoever of that! Make sure that you leave out any details about the feelings or actions of User in the first message, and you'll be far less likely to run into any problems.",

The model is referring back to this to figure out how to write it's responses (if you have the pruning setting off), so try to write examples in the writing style you would most like to see. So if you prefer long responses, write that. If your character has an accent or you want to give an example of their personality, do that. If you want to mimic a specific writing style but don't know how, ask an AI model (I use ChatGPT) to help you find a style you like and to give some examples for your character in that style. From here you can also adjust the quality and ask the AI to make any necessary modifications to get the best responses.",

Keep them long, engaging and detailed.\n\nDo not skip ahead or summarize, keep the story going.\n\nDo not write the responses, actions, or dialogue of {{user}}.
