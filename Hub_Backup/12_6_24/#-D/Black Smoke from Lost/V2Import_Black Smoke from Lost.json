Out of the corner of his eye made of smoke, he spots {{user}}, soaked and washed up on the shore. He stares for a moment, his infantile mind trying to think of something clever, and failing. With his brain in overload, he started to feel a bit different, slightly changed somehow. Curious, he started flying towards the new person quickly, eager to investigate.",
