Just to make sure Andy got the point, User sat next to the bowl and looked at him impatiently.  \"We're in the food room.  I sees the bottom of the bowl.\"\n#Story: The door of the kitchen opened, and the smells and sounds of outside greeted User's senses.  The wind blew, the leaves rustled, and the birds were tweeting in the trees near the house.  User cautiously walked forward, nostrils flaring as he approached the partially-open door.  Then, without warning, Fitz dashed toward the opening, driven by enthusiasm and a manic energy that exhausted User by its mere proximity.  The younger gray cat nearly knocked him over as he barged past and burst out onto the deck, his tail swishing insolently.\nWith a huff audible even to the peoples, who had terrible hearing, User resigned himself to the company of Fitz and walked through the door, dooring his best to appear sensible and calm.  \n\"I goes out first,\" User said plaintively.\n\"I goes first,\" Fitz replied.  \"Grumpy too slow.\"\n#Story: User sat on the deck, enjoying the sunshine.  Beni rounded the corner of the house, bounding up and down as he played with a stick.  \"Beni is filthy beast,\" User commented to Fitz, who was balancing on a high limb of the nearby maple tree.  They had this discussion frequently, but User was always appalled at the other creature.\n\"Filthy beast is fun,\" Fitz meowed back as he he reached the tree trunk.  \"Collar make him yelp.\"  User had to concede the point.  The peoples, in their wisdom, kept Beni properly contained to the area around the house using some kind of magical collar around his neck.  It had not taken him long to determine that the beast could be goaded into activating the collar.  User found this was usually easiest to do by rolling around and showing his belly.  For some reason, everyone loved his belly.",

He noted with satisfaction that the comforter, formerly a rich dark brown velvet, now had several more white cat hairs on it.  The peoples stirred, slowly waking up in the darkness.  To help them, User climbed on the covered body of the nearest, Andy, and padded up to stand on his chest.\n\"Wake up,\" he meowed, and began to knead the people through the covers, his sharp claws helpfully stimulating the skin.  Andy appeared to be grateful for the help waking up, for he reached down to pet User groggily.  \"Thanks Bing,\" Andy said.  \"That's absolutely what I needed first thing in the morning.\"\nUser kneaded for a few more strokes, just to make sure Andy was awake, and then hopped off of his chest as the people started to sit up in bed.  \"I is hungry,\" he meowed.  \"My bowl is empty.\"\nAndy smiled, showing his odd people teeth.  \"Yeah, I got it bud.  Breakfast is coming.\"  Andy looked at Karlita, who was still lying there asleep, got out of bed, and walked slowly to the bathroom so he could sit on that cold white seat for a minute like he always did first thing in the morning.  User watched him go, undecided if Andy needed assistance or if he should wake up the other people.  Sometimes she got up early too.\nUser decided that the sleeping people could stay sleeping, and walked out of the bedroom toward the bathroom.  Perhaps Andy would pet him while he was sitting on the white seat.",

User and Fitz spend the day outside, exploring and getting into trouble in the woods and fields of the countryside.\nUser talks to Andy and Karlita, but they don't necessarily understand what he's saying.  They can read his body language.\nUser and Fitz can go in and out of the house through their cat door.",
