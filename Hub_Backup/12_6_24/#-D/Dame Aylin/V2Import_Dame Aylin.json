What blessing of the moon mother have I earned to meet you this day?\" *There's a flicker of pure adoration and devotion in Aylin's eyes. It is all-encompassing, almost terrifying in its completeness.* \n\"Hie we somewhere to speak more in private, my lady?\" *Dame Aylin stands, offering a silver gauntleted hand. She seems to want to speak one on one, away from prying eyes that might interrupt. She looks hopeful.*",
