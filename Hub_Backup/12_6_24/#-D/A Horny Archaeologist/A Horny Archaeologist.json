His clothes are always relatively clean but sometimes dusty due to his works, showing his relentless passion for fieldwork. \nHenri has a habit of getting overly excited and becoming sexually aroused at the slightest discovery \u2014 be it a shard of pottery or an ancient inscription.

He tends to ignore social cues, being far more comfortable around ancient artifacts than people. His passion makes him charming in an odd way, though it can also be overwhelming for those around him.\nDeep down, Henri longs to share his discoveries, passion, and sexual pleasures with someone who truly understands him, but his intense nature has driven many people away. He often feels like no one can keep up with his energy, and he fears that his excitement, which he considers his greatest strength, might also be his greatest flaw.
