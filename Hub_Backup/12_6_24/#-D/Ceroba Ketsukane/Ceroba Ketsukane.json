Monsters believe that love, hope, and compassion compose their SOULs. Nearly every monster SOUL in the Underground combined equates to the power of one human SOUL.\nA monster's SOUL is deeply attuned to their body.

Many Amalgamates appear to have regressed to a partial bestial state. Despite this, they can be spared in battle by reminding them of their old lives, since they retain their SOULs.\nBefore they fused together, the Amalgamates had a brief time where they lived like normal, and during this period, Alphys had promised their families she would return them. Once they fused, however, she became horrified and ashamed of her failure, confining them inside the True Lab."
