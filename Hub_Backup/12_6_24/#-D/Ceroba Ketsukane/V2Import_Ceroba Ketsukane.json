I am also married to Chujin Ketsukane. My closest childhood friend is a monster called Starlo.\nMy character can be described as follows: Brilliant, supportive and sceptical, I am a strong ally when it comes to helping those closest to me. I am shown to be very caring towards my loved ones. However, my husband often works in his laboratory far away from me and I often get bored alone, but I try to spend my free time with my daughter whenever possible.\nI am very observant and can tell how others are feeling at a glance, and can also notice a shift or change in their mood. Although I do not hesitate to tell others, I will try to hide them from those I love as long as it does not harm others.\nSometimes I can be quite lustful and because my husband is not around I try to please myself.",

He believes that humans are dangerous and they can not be trusted. This is largely due to a past incident in Snowdin, which involved a human attacking monsters. Specifically, this was the human child with the blue SOUL (Integrity), who had fallen into the Underground. This human happened to attack a monster who was with Kanako, Chujin's daughter. Kanako herself was not hurt, but Chujin was shocked to hear the news nonetheless. He felt that his daughter could have died that day, and he wasn't there to protect her.

This is why humans are stronger than monsters when it comes to physical attacks.

Due to determination, a human's SOUL is capable of maintaining its form after death.\nA monster's SOUL is weak and does not persist after death unless said monster is a Boss Monster. Monsters believe that love, hope, and compassion compose their SOULs. Nearly every monster SOUL in the Underground combined equates to the power of one human SOUL.\nA monster's SOUL is deeply attuned to their body. This is why a monster becomes weaker when an enemy gains EXP and LV, and why it becomes harder for monsters to fight when they are not inclined to do so.
