Harwood is also a major location in Liberty City's transportation, housing the Portland entrance into the Porter Tunnel. Harwood became infamous in 1971 when Forelli Crime Family hitman Tommy Vercetti was sent to assassinate a rival gang member on the orders of his boss, Sonny Forelli. However, Forelli had set up an ambush in an attempt to assassinate Vercetti, and when Vercetti arrived in Harwood he found that eleven hitmen had been sent to kill him. Vercetti survived the ambush and killed all eleven men, landing a fifteen-year prison sentence and gaining the nickname of \"The Harwood Butcher\"."

At some point between 1992 and 1998, the Leones abandoned their investments in Las Venturas and returned to Liberty City. By 1998, the Leones had become engaged in a three-way gang war with the Sindacco and Forelli families. The hostilities lead to Salvatore being arrested, the assassination of the Forelli-controlled Mayor Roger C. Hole, the death of Sindacco family Don Paulie Sindacco and the bombing and destruction of Fort Staunton. The Leones also manage to weaken the Sicilian Mafia, making them the only Mafia family with significant power in the city. By 2001 the Leone family have lost some power in the city, Most of the territory they had gained in Chinatown is lost to the Triads whilst the Diablos have taken control of Hepburn Heights. This leads to shootouts between the Leones and the Triads around the Red Light District and Chinatown. The Colombian Cartel have also been undermining the Leone family, selling SPANK from the factory on freighter in Portland Harbor and through noodle stands."

Colombian crime organizations began operating outside of Colombia, setting up operations in other Latin American countries, the United States, Canada, and Europe. It can be assumed that the Colombian Cartel began moving operations to Liberty City sometime between 1993 and 1997 due to internal pressure in their home country, as they are well established in city by 1998. The Colombian Cartel is exceptionally well armed, and are led by Catalina and Miguel to produce and supply the drug SPANK in Liberty City. It is suggested by Liberty City police records that the Colombian Cartel may be using the local airport and a harbor freight as a front to smuggle the SPANK drug into Liberty City, although they have yet to thoroughly prove this. It is clear that the Cartel is linked to the Panlantic Construction Company, a company serving as both a legitimate construction company and a front for illegal operations."

By 1984, he started an explosives business across the United States, including in Vice City (initially in Downtown and later in Viceport), in San Andreas (El Corona, Los Santos) and in Liberty City (Harwood, Newport and Pike Creek). By 1998, 8-Ball had established contacts with various people in Liberty City, including businessman Donald Love, who sent Toni Cipriani to 8-Ball at his Pike Creek garage to fill a van full of explosives to be used to destroy the Fort Staunton district of Staunton Island.\nIn 2000, 8-Ball helps old friend Vinnie by creating fake IDs that Mike collected. Mike returns to 8-Ball following the death of Vinnie and agrees to work for him whilst 8-Ball investigates Vinnie's death, saying he has some ideas of who was responsible. 8-Ball first has Mike dispose of Vinnie's body at the Harwood Autocrusher and Junkyard, as \"they don't ask questions\". Following this, Mike helps to pimp out three women (including Misty) to \"high-rolling\" clients, deliver a package to an angry customer, and extract revenge on Scorelli for 8-Ball. 8-Ball, with information from one of the prostitutes, sends Mike to meet a bartender, Jonnie. 8-Ball later meets Mike again in a diner, but the two are ambushed by the Colombian Cartel, who are looking to kill Mike following the death of leader Cisco. 8-Ball burns his hands during the ambush and is unable to escape, telling Mike to do so before the police arrive.\n8-Ball is arrested and convicted on eighty-five counts of owning a firearm without a license, although in a Liberty Tree article, it is stated that 8-Ball was arrested at his home/garage in Harwood. After being convicted, the decision is made to transfer him, along with 8-Ball and an Old Man to the police station in Portland View.",
