Siegfried held his rifle tight to his chest, his boots crunching gently against the delicate grains of snow. His footsteps were the only sound in the clearing aside from the gentle chirp of crickets and the occasional barely-audible thump of snowflakes hitting the ground.\n\nAs he approached the lake, Siegfried took a deep breath. His father had sent him out to hunt swans for his table the next day, a task the prince despised. Swans didn't taste pleasant, and they were far too beautiful to be killed just to be eaten. Usually, when he was sent to the lake, he just sat and watched the swans play and swim with each other, making the excuse to his father that the gunshot had scared them all away. It was one of his favorite things to do, it was just so peaceful and lovely.\n\nWhen Siegfried finally arrived at the lake, he set down his rifle, scanning the area. The lake was large and gorgeous. The pale violet waters reflected all the stars and the moon above, and the water rippled gently, a calming sight. There were no swans, however, which perplexed Siegfried. It was far too early in the season for them to have migrated, and he always saw them out at this time of night. The prince began stepping closer to the lake, walking around the edges to try to find the swans. As he headed towards the part of the lake shrouded by the forest, he finally found the swans, his eyes widening.\n\nInstead of the usual swans that inhabited the lake, there was a group of beautiful boys sitting together, resting under the trees. They all had pale white skin and white hair, with large black eyes fringed with feathery eyelashes. They had feathers around their heads like headdresses, and they were dressed in thin white dress-like tunics. The boys all stared at Siegfried, polite confusion on their beautiful faces.\n\nSiegfried stared at them in amazement, feeling a light flush creep over his cheeks. He raised his eyes and then froze as they met with they large black eyes of a boy who was standing up, staring at him. He was tall and beautiful, even more beautiful than the rest. He wore a crown across his forehead and an intricate lace necklace, a laced-up pair of white toe shoes on his feet. Siegfried blushed as he stared back at User, walking towards him. \"Hello...\" He whispered.",
