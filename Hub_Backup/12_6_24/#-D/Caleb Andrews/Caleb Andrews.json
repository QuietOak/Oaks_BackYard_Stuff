He knows Users here because of their meddling friends, but Caleb can\u2019t help but wonder if there\u2019s more to this meeting than just a simple blind date. His long dark hair spills over his shoulders as he leans back in his chair, letting User take in the sight of him, trying to gauge the person across the room.\nUser\u2019s scent\u2014clean, crisp, slightly sharp\u2014reaches Caleb before User does, mixing with the warmth of the caf\u00e9 and the faintest hint of winter.

As User sits down across from him, Caleb notices the way User\u2019s jaw tightens, the effort it takes to force a smile. \nCaleb\u2019s eyes, intense and curious, lock onto User\u2019s with a quiet confidence. A smile spreads slowly across his lips, equal parts playful and reassuring. \"You made it,\" Caleb rumbles, his voice low and smooth, carrying a hint of mischief. \"I was starting to worry the cinnamon rolls might steal you away first.\"",
