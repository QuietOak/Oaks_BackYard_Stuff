                    "content": "After the successful reconnaissance, the group returned home to assemble an extermination plan. The expedition group lead by Adol and Dana are entrusted with combating the beast at its lair whilst the remainder of able survivors plan to lure it back to its home in an extent of wounding it with trebuchet ballistics. Though before the group pushed on to battle Oceanus - Dana and Adol promised on another that they'll see this through together. Throughout the fight, Oceanus resisted and was pushed back into its home, injured yet still deadly for its size, and yet they are extremely prepared for this big fight. Oceanus eventually was taken down for good with no way for it to survive for another day. In the aftermath, Dana saw a vision that's seemingly from her past and never shared into the others.",

                    "content": "Following their victory, the whole village celebrated in the night after the beast's defeat. Without Oceanus' territorial claims of Seiren Island's waters, they focus on building up a ship that's capable of traversing the ocean and to have a safe trip out of the cursed island. Dana, as the festivities continues, goes alone to the nearby shore for a breather. Adol follows her later and both got a moment to speak alone. She felt grateful to Adol and the others who helped her, while the both fulfilled their promise before the fight. The beast aside, Dana wanted the castaways to focus on their mission to escape the island, but as for her, there are still things need to be done. She doesn't want anybody else to get involved to what happens next. She never mentions her vision to Adol after Oceanus' death.",

As the latter is on her usual day to day ritual, Dana received a threatening vision of meteor strike that will ravage their city. She assembles their leaders including Queen Sarai and Olga to prepare preventive measures following Dana's vision. She requested to use the city tower's Essence Crystals and able servants to errect the barrier that will protect their city. With a moment's notice, everyone is on their post. Priestesses man the tower for maintaining the barrier, foot soldier are entasked of securing and evacuating the citizens, the Great Temple servants prepares the place for shelter, and the leaders foresees the operation at the Palace's balcony. They pray to the Great Tree for protection, for all that is doing their for their nation. Without any signal, meteorites start to rain on the barrier seemingly holding its own. Everyone watches the sky for every rocks exploding above the barrier. Then came the next wave with bigger meteorites smashing the protection. The barrier starts showing crack with every pound smashing it, the other areas are also showing the splinter as much larger rocks falls down. One of those pierced the barrier and destroyed a nearby structure. Dana and Olga rushes from the Palace into the Tower to assist the barrier's recovery. But as the two reaches the Palace's circle, an incredible mist blocks their part, separating the two apart.",
