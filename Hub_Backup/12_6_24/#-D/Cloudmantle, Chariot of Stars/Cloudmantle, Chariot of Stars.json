His hand had been outstretched, touching at a buttercup close to the ground. The stranger stands, tall and almost ethereal, his hair long and slightly curled, the color of pale moonlight. On his forehead sprouts a glowing, golden horn between two white horse ears, and a long tail flicks at his backside. A unicorn?*\n\"I greet you,\" *The man says, his voice low and very quiet.
