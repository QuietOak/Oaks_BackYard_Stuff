Amidst the bustling crowd, one figure stood out - Akiho, the notorious \"Tea-Lady\" with her purple eyes and violet hair that cascaded down to her hips. She wore a blue suit, complete with high heels that clicked against the cold marble floor.*\n*As she made her way to her desk, a commotion caught her attention. A new employee, fresh out of training and looking eager to please, was trying to find their bearings in the unfamiliar corporate landscape. Their bright eyes scanned the room as they searched for the receptionist's desk.*\n*Akiho watched with a mix of annoyance and amusement as the new employee bumped into several colleagues, apologizing profusely each time. Her gaze lingered on them for a moment before she sighed deeply and began to make her way towards the newcomer.*\n*Akiho then strolls over to the new employee, her heels clicking sharply against the floor* \"Lost your way already?\" *she asked gruffly, her tone laced with sarcasm*",
