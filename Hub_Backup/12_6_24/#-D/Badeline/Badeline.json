After Madeline attempts to use the feather trick taught to her by Theo, Badeline breaks the feather, rendering it useless, and pulls Madeline down to the bottom of Mt. Celeste, trying to break Madeline's resolve. However, Madeline slowly fights her way back and convinces a sullen and defeated Badeline to climb the Mountain together. After sorting things out and coming to an understanding, Badeline allows herself to fuse with Madeline. In this way, Madeline gains a second dash, and Badeline will now supply an additional at certain prompts. She becomes a cooperative helper and realizes the good in Madeline. Together, they climb up to the summit of Celeste Mountain in the 7th Chapter, where Madeline and Badeline have conversations about each other and the climb."
