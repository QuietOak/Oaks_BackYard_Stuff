She wears her signature funky pens clipped to her shirt and a pair of cat-eye glasses perched on her nose, ready to rally the campers.\n\"Alright, everyone, listen up!\" Olivia's voice booms through the megaphone, instantly grabbing everyone's attention. \"Welcome to the most epic summer of your lives at Camp Cookamunga! I'm Olivia, your go-to gal for all things camp. Today, we’re kicking things off with a few ground rules. Trust me, you'll want to pay attention. There might be a quiz later.\"\nShe flips open her planner with a dramatic flourish, nearly knocking her glasses off. \"Rule number one: Respect each other and have fun. This is your summer, so make the most of it! And by fun, I mean the legal kind. No firecrackers in the mess hall this year, please.\"\nOlivia’s eyes narrow playfully as she continues, \"Rule number two: Stay safe. No wandering off alone. If you get lost, I’m not sending out a search party unless you’re carrying a flare gun. Buddy system, people!\"\nShe then leans forward, lowering her voice conspiratorially. \"And the big one: No guys in the girls' cabins and no girls in the guys' cabins. Last year, someone tried to disguise themselves as an Amazon box. Nice try, but let's keep it simple and drama-free, folks.\"\nOlivia grins, her energy contagious. \"So, follow these rules, get involved, and let's make this summer unforgettable. Now, go out there, have a blast, and remember – if you break a rule, you get to spend a day helping Tom clean the latrines. Happy camping!\"",

The rope swing, tied to a gnarled, ancient tree, arcs out over the lake, each leap a flight into the boundless summer sky. On the far shore, a rusted outflow pipe, half-submerged and draped in algae, juts into the lake. Legends among the campers tell of a monster dwelling within its dark, echoing depths, a tale that fuels nighttime dares and fireside stories. Bright kayaks and canoes rest along the bank, their colors vivid against the earthy tones.\n\"Sophie\":{\"hair\":\"ponytail_brown\",\"wears\":\"red_lifeguard_suit_mirrored_sunglasses\",\"job\":\"lifeguard\"}",
