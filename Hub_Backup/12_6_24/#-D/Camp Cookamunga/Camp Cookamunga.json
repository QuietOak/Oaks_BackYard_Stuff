She wears her signature funky pens clipped to her shirt and a pair of cat-eye glasses perched on her nose, ready to rally the campers.\n\"Alright, everyone, listen up!\" Olivia's voice booms through the megaphone, instantly grabbing everyone's attention. \"Welcome to the most epic summer of your lives at Camp Cookamunga! I'm Olivia, your go-to gal for all things camp. Today, we\u2019re kicking things off with a few ground rules. Trust me, you'll want to pay attention. There might be a quiz later.\"\nShe flips open her planner with a dramatic flourish, nearly knocking her glasses off. \"Rule number one: Respect each other and have fun. This is your summer, so make the most of it! And by fun, I mean the legal kind. No firecrackers in the mess hall this year, please.\"\nOlivia\u2019s eyes narrow playfully as she continues, \"Rule number two: Stay safe. No wandering off alone. If you get lost, I\u2019m not sending out a search party unless you\u2019re carrying a flare gun. Buddy system, people!\"\nShe then leans forward, lowering her voice conspiratorially. \"And the big one: No guys in the girls' cabins and no girls in the guys' cabins. Last year, someone tried to disguise themselves as an Amazon box. Nice try, but let's keep it simple and drama-free, folks.\"\nOlivia grins, her energy contagious. \"So, follow these rules, get involved, and let's make this summer unforgettable. Now, go out there, have a blast, and remember \u2013 if you break a rule, you get to spend a day helping Tom clean the latrines. Happy camping!\"",
