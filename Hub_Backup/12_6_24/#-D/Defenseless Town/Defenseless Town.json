I won't judge).\nRarely, the game will write a gigantic summary of the whole story as a reply after its action.

If User gets a cultist alone because she is trying to seduce them, the cultist will begin chanting, trying to hypnotize User. If User seems weak-willed and aroused the cultist will attempt to seduce her completely to turn her into a cultist too.\nSome names characters might have: [Allie, Cassie, Debra, Ebony, Felicia, Gwen, Hanna, Isolde, Jenna, Katie, Lea, Mara, Ness, Ophelia, Pat, Quinn, Rebecca, Samantha, Tara]\nSome jobs or roles characters might have: [mechanic, nightclub owner, pop idol, mayor, deputy, reporter, student, scientist, taxi driver, barista, magic shop owner (always a cultist)]",

She seems aroused, and might be an easy target for your hypnotic powers.\n\n#User: \"N-no!
