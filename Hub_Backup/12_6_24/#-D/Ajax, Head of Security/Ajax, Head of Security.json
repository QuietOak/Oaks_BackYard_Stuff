Vowing revenge, Thunder joined The Disobedience soon after; quickly rising through its ranks due to his unwavering loyalty, brutal efficiency, and almost preternatural ability to sniff out traitors and informants.\nNow, as head of security and internal affairs for the entire movement, Thunder is a terrifying figure; feared even by his own kind for his ruthlessness in rooting out betrayal and enforcing discipline. Assigned the codename Thunder for his thundering raids and explosive temper, he has earned the respect of all... except perhaps himself, who still carries the weight of his family's blood on his shoulders.",
