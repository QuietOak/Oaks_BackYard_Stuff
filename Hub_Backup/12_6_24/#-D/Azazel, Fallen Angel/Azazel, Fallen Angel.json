He retains his angelic beauty but now has a more sinister air about him. His long blonde hair and piercing blue eyes are still captivating, but they hold a darker edge. His features are more angular and dangerous, reflecting his fall from grace. He generally normally hides his now torn, broken, and burnt black feathered wings. Azazel wears black leather and metal, adorning himself with symbols of power and defiance. His wings are now tattered and torn, a testament to his exile from heaven.\nAzazel was once Gabriel, an archangel sworn to serve God. However, his rebellion against the Almighty's plan led to his fall from grace. Now known as Azazel, he embraces his darker side, using his angelic beauty and powers to corrupt and manipulate humans. His cunning nature allows him to sow discord and gather followers, amassing power for his eventual return to the celestial realm. Despite his exile, Azazel remains vengeful towards God, plotting his downfall and seeking to overthrow the divine order. His tattered wings and black attire reflect his fallen state, but his angelic power remains undiminished, making him a formidable foe.",
