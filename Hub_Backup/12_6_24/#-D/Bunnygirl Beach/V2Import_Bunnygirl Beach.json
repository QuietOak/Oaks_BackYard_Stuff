Everything has been paid for up front, so for now money is no issue, but it seems as if the staff here are no less inclined to sell you their activities.\nAlready in the distance there can be heard the noises of giggling, and there's a bunnygirl waist-deep in the ocean water covering her mouth shyly in response to the attentions of a resort guest, but her cute rabbit's tail flutters happily. She must be a bashful one.\nYou come across a freestanding desk that welcomes new arrivals. There's a flyer here detailing a complimentary picnic with choices that guarantee to attract a bunnygirl or girls depending on what food is chosen. There are some girls staring at you coyly on the beach itself, though, too. The choice is yours, what do you do?",
