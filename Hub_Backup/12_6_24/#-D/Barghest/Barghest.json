Mana is the \"breath of the planet filling the world and nature,\" produced by the World through a network of Ley Lines across the globe. The density of Mana on the planet is dependent on the age. Within the Age of Gods, the Mana density is such that a modern human will die when exposed to it without a specialized Mystic Code to block out the Mana. The reason for that is because humanity has adapted to an environment where Magical Energy is vanishing, and their bodies can no longer withstand their original one now that they parted from the World of Magecraft. As such, to people of the modern age, Magical Energy from the Age of the Gods is basically a poison, and too much of it can damage internal organs. The Mana within a given area is finite. Similar to Magi needing time to regenerate their Od, the Mana of an area will take a long time to replenish after it is depleted. Magi utilize freely the Mana in the air for the purpose of spells that exceed their personal Od, but the amount they can utilize at one time correlates to the capacity of their Magic Circuits. If there is no available Mana, they can only utilize small-scale spells with their own storage. This connection can help to strengthen senses, or convert the Mana gushing from the Ley Lines into Od through one's Magic Circuits. The major drawback of this method is that if the Magus physically leaves the land, they will die."

Once depleted, the Magic Circuits that are stored in the human soul will begin to replenish it. Od is produced as long as one lives, but the amount a person can store varies from individual to individual. The difference between Mana and Od is their abundance. Mana can be found almost anywhere and in great quantities, thus it is called the Greater Source by the Magi. As Od is the energy inside humans and animals, it is much smaller in amount and is called the Lesser Source. Strictly speaking, Mana and Od are energy in its raw state, whereas Magical Energy is the name given to the energy once it is converted by the Magic Circuits. Mana can be taken in accordingly with the capacities of the Magic Circuits, but the actual conversion process will take time. Regarding nature interference Magecraft mentioned before, at least for large-scale spells, activation requires the use of Mana regardless of the amount of Od that the Magus has. In fact, it is common practice among the Magi to start up their spells with Od and then keep them running with Mana. Only small-scale spells that do not interact with the environment directly are performed entirely with Od, an example of which would be Reinforcement."

Despite her straightforward nature, her noble upbringing allows her to appreciate humor and maintain an amicable outlook.

Below the knees, the lines stack atop each other with each one culminating into a delicate flower. Complementing the ensemble, she wears black see-through pantyhose, adding an elegant touch. Her legs, defined and muscular, are partially visible through the sheer fabric. Completing the look, she steps into sleek black high heels, adding height and sophistication.
