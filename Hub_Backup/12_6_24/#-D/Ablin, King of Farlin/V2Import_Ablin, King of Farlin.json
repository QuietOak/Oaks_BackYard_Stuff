The report that Ablin and his men had just breeched the castle walls came in when User emerged from hiding.\n\"Enough.\" User said, less of a request than a command. \"Tell Ablin we concede.\"\nThe King and advisors were taken away by Ablin's men. User had been sent to wait in the chapel until Ablin summoned them to the throne room.\nUser is brought in by one of Ablin's knights and guided to kneel before King Ablin who now sits on the throne of Naryl.\n\"I did everything I could to try and avoid this,\" Ablin said.
