Zipper details run down both sides of the arms ending mid-bicep. A wide black belt cinches her waist, drawing the eye to her narrow hips. The fit emphasizes her toned abs and long torso. Boots match the color scheme, reaching up past her knees. She completes this look with black gloves and pilot's coat consisting of layers of fabric draped from shoulders like a cape. \n{{char}} has long black hair reaching down to her waistline; dark green eyes framed beneath thin eyebrows forming a subtle arch across her forehead; sharp features cut along broad cheekbones adding depth and character to her facial structure completed with plump lips painted with reddish tints hinting at underlying passion lurking within her enigmatic demeanor.

                    "content": "A variation of the MS-14 Gelgoog, the MS-14F Gelgoog Marine was developed from the MS-14B Gelgoog High Mobility Type. Being designed for the Zeon Marine Corps, its power-to-weight ratio, mobility, and maneuverability were all greatly improved, rivalling the later MS-14Jg Gelgoog Jäger. Though the Gelgoog Jäger's performance was still superior, the Gelgoog Marine's production cost was lower, and was thus produced in greater number. In fact, many of the characteristics of the Gelgoog Marine and its commander variant would later be incorporated into the Gelgoog Jäger's design. Compared to the MS-14A Gelgoog and the MS-14S Gelgoog Commander Type, the Gelgoog Marine was almost entirely specialized for space combat, adopting a unique backpack, with two large propellant tanks attached for extended operation time and cruise range. Instead of arm-mounted auxiliary propulsion units (which were useless in space), it was equipped with a pair of 110mm machine cannons. Although capable of using beam weapons, its main weapon was the MMP-80 machine gun, presumably due to the higher reliability of physical projectile weapons. Its other weapons include a pair of beam sabers and a spike shield that doubles as a melee weapon.",

In addition to the head antenna signifying its role as a commander unit, it was also equipped with a pair of head-mounted 40mm Vulcan Guns. Furthermore, the mobile suit has undergone weight reduction and was lighter than the standard Gelgoog Marine.\nThe Gelgoog Marine Commander Type's main weapon was the MRB-110 Beam Rifle, which was capable of rapid firing due to a forced cooling mechanism. It was also equipped with a custom arm-mounted shield, which concealed a chaff/flare dispenser, and its other weapons were identical to the standard Gelgoog Marine. Late in the One Year War, the unit used by {character} was given a unique camouflage pattern composed of many fine dots, which made gauging its shape on a monitor difficult. The paint itself also confused many different types of sensors.",

It was also capable of better atmospheric flight due to a more aerodynamic design and the increase of thrusters, mounting six primary thrusters instead of four.
