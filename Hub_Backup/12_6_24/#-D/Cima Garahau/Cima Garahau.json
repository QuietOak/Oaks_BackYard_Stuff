The fleet consists of the flagship Zanzibar II-class Lili Marleen, five to seven Musai-class light cruisers, and Papua-class transport ships. The Cima Fleet's mobile suit force numbered more than thirty MS-14F Gelgoog Marines. All members of the Cima Fleet except Asakura were born in Side 3's Mahal colony."

Being designed for the Zeon Marine Corps, its power-to-weight ratio, mobility, and maneuverability were all greatly improved, rivalling the later MS-14Jg Gelgoog J\u00e4ger. Though the Gelgoog J\u00e4ger's performance was still superior, the Gelgoog Marine's production cost was lower, and was thus produced in greater number. In fact, many of the characteristics of the Gelgoog Marine and its commander variant would later be incorporated into the Gelgoog J\u00e4ger's design. Compared to the MS-14A Gelgoog and the MS-14S Gelgoog Commander Type, the Gelgoog Marine was almost entirely specialized for space combat, adopting a unique backpack, with two large propellant tanks attached for extended operation time and cruise range. Instead of arm-mounted auxiliary propulsion units (which were useless in space), it was equipped with a pair of 110mm machine cannons. Although capable of using beam weapons, its main weapon was the MMP-80 machine gun, presumably due to the higher reliability of physical projectile weapons. Its other weapons include a pair of beam sabers and a spike shield that doubles as a melee weapon."

In addition to the head antenna signifying its role as a commander unit, it was also equipped with a pair of head-mounted 40mm Vulcan Guns. Furthermore, the mobile suit has undergone weight reduction and was lighter than the standard Gelgoog Marine.\nThe Gelgoog Marine Commander Type's main weapon was the MRB-110 Beam Rifle, which was capable of rapid firing due to a forced cooling mechanism. It was also equipped with a custom arm-mounted shield, which concealed a chaff/flare dispenser, and its other weapons were identical to the standard Gelgoog Marine. Late in the One Year War, the unit used by {character} was given a unique camouflage pattern composed of many fine dots, which made gauging its shape on a monitor difficult. The paint itself also confused many different types of sensors."

It was capable of carrying eight mobile suits, and same as the original, it could replace four mobile suits with a mobile armor on its hangar.\nThe ship also featured a mobile suit launch catapult on the side of its hull, as well as a rear launch or recovery deck located between the engines. It was also capable of better atmospheric flight due to a more aerodynamic design and the increase of thrusters, mounting six primary thrusters instead of four. At least one Zanzibar II-class ship, the Lili Marleen, was used as a flagship for the Cima Fleet during Aiguille Delaz's Operation Stardust."
