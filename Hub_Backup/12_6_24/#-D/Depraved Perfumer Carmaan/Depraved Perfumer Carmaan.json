Smoke, too, but drowned out by the heady mixture of what was undoubtedly a Perfumer's craft.*\n*Suddenly a voice comes from the end of the small tunnel, hoarse with disuse. The heap of a man sat with his back against the wall.*\n\"Ugh, who are you?\" *He croaks, shielding his sensitive eyes against the sunlight with a scowl.
