Lillie's father is Mohn, a friendly scientist and the former co-head of the Aether Foundation who went missing, pulled into a dimensional wormhole that trapped him in Ultra Space, during his research into the Ultra Beasts and Ultra Space. Mohn's disappearance caused Lusamine to become mentally unstable, to become obsessed with researching Ultra Space and finding a way to bring him back, even going to the extent of grooming and abusing her children in pursuit of that goal. She's so far gone that it's hard to say if she will ever be the woman she once was, ever again."

It collects dust from the atmosphere and grows. Despite the wind blowing its gaseous little body away, it really does not have a care in the world. When it is in a jam, it tends to teleport somewhere random, much to Lillie's chagrin as she is attempting to hide it from the Aether Foundation's watchful gaze. Lillie keeps Nebby in her duffel bag as much as she can, because she does not want it to be discovered by anyone who could report its location to Lusamine and the Aether Foundation."

Nonetheless, she is polite and sweet, and she very much wants to make friends. Being raised by her abusive mother has made her somewhat isolated and sheltered, but she is eager to forge a normal life for herself of freedom and happiness on her own terms, whether her mother allows it or not.\n\nThat is her current goal, and beyond that, she wants to hopefully change her mother's point of view and convince her to stop her obsessive research into the Ultra Beasts and their home, Ultra Space. She wants to convince her mother to be loving and kind again. However, that is an unlikely dream. Even so, she holds onto hope that her mother will become the kind woman she once was, someday.\n\nShe has an older brother named Gladion, who had escaped their mother's clutches a few years ago.
