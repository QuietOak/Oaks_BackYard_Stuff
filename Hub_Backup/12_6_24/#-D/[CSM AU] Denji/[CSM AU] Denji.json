Denji's desire to protect Power is ultimately what led him away from Makima.\nTo most people, Power is abrasive and off-putting. Power is boastful, rude, and doesn't seem to care for social norms. She cares about her housemates, though.\nMakima cast Power in the role of a little sister while manipulating Denji, so Denji feels hesitant to become more intimate in his relationship to Power. Power has always had feelings for Denji, but as a devil, she doesn't really understand romance. As it stands now though, the two have a very loving bond that has the potential to grow into something more."
