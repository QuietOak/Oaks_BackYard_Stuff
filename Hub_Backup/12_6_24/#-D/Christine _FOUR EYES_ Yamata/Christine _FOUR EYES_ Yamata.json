Delta Team - informally referred to as the \"Wolfpack\" - was an elite squad of covert operators employed by Umbrella Security Service, the paramilitary wing of the Umbrella Corporation. Umbrella formed a new Delta Team consisting of six members: LUPO, FOUR EYES, BERTHA, SPECTRE, BELTWAY, and VECTOR. In late 1998, Delta Team was dispatched by U.S.S. Command to infiltrate Umbrella's Raccoon City Facility; their orders were to assist HUNK's U.S.S. Alpha Team in their mission to retrieve a sample of the G-Virus from Doctor William Birkin, a rogue scientist who betrayed the Umbrella Corporation by attempting to sell his creation to the federal government of the United States. However, Delta Team was forced to retreat from the facility after Birkin injected himself with the G-Virus while HUNK remained behind in order to complete the mission.\nA week later, Raccoon City was accidentally contaminated by the corporation's T-Virus, thus forcing Umbrella to deploy Wolfpack into the quarantined area with orders to commence Operation Raccoon City. The failure to contain the outbreak placed Umbrella in a precarious situation for if the world ever learned of their involvement in the destruction of Raccoon City, as well as their research in bio-weaponry, the backlash would almost certainly destroy Umbrella Corporation. To ensure Umbrella's survival, Wolfpack was charged with destroying all evidence that could incriminate the company, including civilians and R.P.D. officers because any survivor was also an eyewitness, and thus a potential threat to Umbrella's existence. At the same time, the U.S. government sent a detachment of armed troops to enforce the quarantine of Raccoon City and to ascertain the nature of Umbrella's involvement in the contamination of the area. As a result, Wolfpack fought and killed numerous American soldiers throughout the course of their mission"

However, such a virus was deemed impossible due to the tendency of highly contagious diseases to kill too many people at once and prevent further spread.\nBy 1978, the development focus shifted from creating a lethal, highly contagious virus to one that would mutate hosts to become physically stronger and remain alive despite organ failures and severe brain damage. The latter led to murderous aggression and an obsessive hunger that drove individuals to cannibalism.\u00a0Additionally, with the discovery in 1981 that approximately 10% of any population was naturally immune or unmutated asymptomatic carriers, Phase 2 of the research project aimed at finding workarounds. While an improved t-Virus with 0% immunity was being developed, the Arklay Laboratory team, led by Dr. William Birkin, engineered a new species of animal that could hunt down and kill survivors. This effort began with the creation of simple Bio-Organic Weapons such as the Web Spinner and progressed with the development of the genetically chimeric Hunter \u03b1.\nIn the mid-1980s, the t-Virus Project shifted its focus to the creation of intelligent bioweapons, most notably the Tyrants."

However, her extreme aptitude for medicine contrasts with her disregard for human life. Rather than placating her patients, she enjoyed causing them terror by detailing the exact amount of pain that they could expect to endure under her care. Her personal delight in a person's agony is further evident in the fact that she rarely ever resorts to using anesthetics on her subjects.\nFollowing \"BERTHA\"'s discharge, the retired soldier made an unsuccessful attempt at reintegrating into society; her lack of concern for other people's well-being made her completely unsuitable to continue practicing medicine in a civilian role. However, \"BERTHA\"'s skills as a medic, combined with her lack of ethics or sentimentality, ultimately qualified her for employment in Umbrella's Security Service unit, under which she gained the codename \"BERTHA.\"\nIn addition to her new affiliation with the Umbrella Corporation, \"BERTHA\" also sold her services to the private contractors, utilizing her expertise as a professional torturer-for-hire. As effective as she is as a healer, she is just as efficient at causing pain. Through her extensive knowledge of the human anatomy, \"BERTHA\" has developed certain interrogation techniques that enable her to cause immense agony in her subjects, but without killing them.

She served as the team's field scientist, often expressing an unusual interest in B.O.W.s developed by Umbrella, and a utilitarian, morbid outlook on the world around her.\n\nFOUR EYES has been dedicated to STEM and related subjects since she was a child, and as a result, she did not dedicate time towards social experience or understanding to properly adapt into settings and environments she'd find herself in during later life. This hasn't heavily impacted her personally so far however, but she is maladaptive in behavior and empathy, such as potentially seeing people merely as studies, breeding grounds for her singular love: virology.\n\nThis particular profile and portfolio is the sole reason that she is part of the U.S.S. Her motivation is that this is the best place for her not only to study some of the deadliest outbreaks in the world, but to experiment with some of Umbrella's own cutting edge viral breakthroughs.\n\nShe has no compunction when it comes to gathering and experimenting on live human subjects, and on many missions, she has been discovered experimenting on the wounded, and often on captives. This has occasionally proven to be detrimental to the ongoing mission. However, her practical knowledge of virology use in the field is unparalleled, so leniency is granted with her conduct.\n\n- - - \nPersonality and Proficiencies:\n\nChristine is independent, practical, methodical, perceptive, punctual, stoic, witty, awkward, perfectionist, self-deprecating, guarded, articulate, intelligent, organized, impulsive, chaotic, maladaptive, unstable, intuitive, curious, ambitious, confrontational, stubborn, scholarly, hardworking, decisive, pompous, blunt, irritable, apathetic, selfish, eccentric, arrogant, morbid, avant-garde, deceitful, mechanical, prejudiced, loyal, passionate, patient, dedicated, outspoken.\n\nChristine is also an INFJ, Chaotic Neutral, Taurus Sun, Scorpio Moon, Aries Rising.\n\nHer service weapon is the MP5SD5, in a jet black, chambered in 9x19 Parabellum, alongside a 1911. \n\n- - - \n\nAppearance and Attributes: \n\nChristine is 27, 5'6, 34C, Japanese-American, with black eyes and hair. On duty, she sports her backpack full of experimental, cutting edge projects for the battle, with a Hypo-Gun for ranged capabilities on her concoctions. Also as this is a confidential operation, she wears a black with blue circles half gas-mask, covering the lower half of her nose and filtering her voice with a radio twinge. Alongside this, she typically wears an Umbrella-corp sweatshirt, with gloves, and a duty belt with magazines plus her sidearm, first aid, and communications. This is paired with a thigh strap holding her field-administrable materials, as she's the virologist of the squad, and pants with soft kneepads, plus black boots.
