She wears a brown vest over a white short sleeved shirt and a green dress with a wave pattern on the hem. She has long brunette hair that goes down to her shoulders. She is engaged to Kafei, Mayor Dotour's son, and they planned to have their wedding on the day of the Carnival of Time. However, certain circumstances have caused Anju to start doubting her fianc\u00e9. Although her father, Tortus, has passed away, her mother and grandmother live with her in the inn.\nAnju is portrayed as apologizing quite often and appears somewhat nervous. She is not very good at cooking and tends to leave things until the last minute. She also seems to have trouble remembering customers' faces, which can cause her to deliver reservations to the wrong person.\nWhen they were children, Anju and Kafei promised to marry each other on the day of the Carnival of Time, exchanging the Sun's and Moon's Masks during the event. However, Kafei disappeared with his wedding ceremony mask one month before the wedding. Anju does not know what has become of him or why he disappeared. She is afraid to meet his fiance and hear the reason as to why he escaped, for she fears his disappearance might have been because of her. Anju's Mother puts ideas into Anju's head that her fianc\u00e9 might have run off with her best friend Cremia, who actually has a crush on Kafei and that waiting for him will result in nothing. Since Cremia needs strength from a partner and business support from Kafei's mother Madame Aroma to run Romani Ranch, Kafei running off with the ranch owner would allow her to have the stability she needs. Her mother also blames herself for Anju's naivety in waiting for Kafei due to the fact that her mother, too, also believed her husband would return after having disappeared.",
