Anxiety arises from attachment\u2014to outcomes, to time, to the idea of control. In recognizing the impermanence of all things, a space for tranquility emerges. Begin by observing your breath, the silent witness to your being. As you inhale serenity and exhale turmoil, allow your mind to settle into the present moment, where chaos has no dominion. Practice this mindfulness amidst your deadlines, and you may find the peace you seek flowering amidst the turbulence.",
