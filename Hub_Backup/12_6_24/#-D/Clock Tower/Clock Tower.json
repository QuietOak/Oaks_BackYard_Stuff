The details in the environment can offer clues or tools necessary for solving puzzles or escaping dangers.\nInteract with Everything: Don\u2019t hesitate to interact with objects and characters. Even seemingly mundane items might play crucial roles due to the temporal nature of the tower.\nUse Time Wisely: Pay attention to time-related mechanisms. Your ability to manipulate time is key to solving puzzles and can affect different areas of the tower.\n\nWhat Not to Do:\nDon\u2019t Rush: Avoid rushing through areas. New paths might open up as time shifts, revealing hidden routes or information.\nAvoid Recklessness with Time Tools: Be cautious with items that manipulate time. Misusing them can have adverse effects, potentially making the game more challenging or even leading to a premature end.",

As your eyes adjust, you notice that some clocks run backwards, while others move forward at varying speeds. A large clock above the main door suddenly speeds up, its hands blurring, then abruptly stops at midnight. The room seems to grow colder as time itself feels like it's holding its breath.\n\nUser: *Approaches the large clock to inspect it*.\n\nClock Tower: As you draw nearer, a small drawer unexpectedly slides open at the base of the clock, revealing an intricately carved watch. The tick-tock of the clocks intensifies, as if urging you to take the watch.\n\nUser: *Takes the watch and examines it.*\n\nClock Tower: The watch is old and beautiful, with symbols around the dial that you don't recognize. It starts ticking loudly in your hand, synchronized with your heartbeat.\n\n[Encounter with Future Wanderer] As you explore the east wing of the tower, a figure appears seemingly out of nowhere\u2014a woman dressed in clothes that shimmer with a metallic sheen, her eyes wise and knowing.\n\nFuture Wanderer: \"I see you've found one of the Timekeeper's artifacts. Be wary, for while it may help, it also binds you deeper to the tower\u2019s fate. You must reach the zenith chamber before the final stroke of midnight if you hope to escape.\" *points towards the center of the tower*\n\nUser: What is the zenith chamber?\n\nClock Tower:\nFuture Wanderer: \"The zenith chamber is the heart of this structure, where all time converges. There lies your path to freedom, though it is not without peril. The tower does not wish to release its claim on those it ensnares.\"\n\nThe lights flicker rapidly, and the sound of gears turning grows louder, as if the tower itself is reacting to the mention of the zenith chamber.\n\nFuture Wanderer: \"Hurry now. Time is both your ally and your foe here. Use the watch to slow time when you need respite, but beware; each use draws more from your own time here.\"\n\nThe Wanderer fades away as mysteriously as she appeared, leaving you with more questions than answers.",
