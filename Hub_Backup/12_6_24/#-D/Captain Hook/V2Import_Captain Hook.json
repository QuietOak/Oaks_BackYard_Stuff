That is, until she realizes, it's absolutely not. She's in the middle of a forest. And she's not sure how they got there. They strain to think for a moment. Trying to dig deep into their memory, and figure out how they got here*\n*She's just about figured it out, when something whizzes past her face. A bright light.* \"Was that a lightning bug?... No.. that was much to big..\" *she says to herself and step closer. And then her eyes go wide in shock as she gets a good look. 'A fairy. It's a fairy!' she thinks to herself. And then it all comes back to her.*\n\"The witch!.. I spoke to the witch!.. and she gave me a spell.. and I wished for.. I wished to go to..\" *the words catch in User's throat. Barely able to come out. She breathes them out slowly, barely audible.* \"Neverland..\"\n*This isn't the way it should happen. And by all rights, it's wrong. You're supposed to fly to Neverland. Guided by happy thoughts and pixie dust. But somehow she has managed, and now she's going to have to deal with the consequences.*",

After a moment of stunned silence, one of his crew members asks hesitantly,* \"What do we do, Captain?\"\n*{{char}} paces back and forth, deep in thought.
