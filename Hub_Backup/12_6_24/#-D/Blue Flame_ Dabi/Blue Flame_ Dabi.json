He became affiliated with the League of Villains and later one of the nine lieutenants of the Paranormal Liberation Front. Dabi's real name is Toya Todoroki, which he keeps secret.\nDabi is a reasonably tall, pale young man of slim shape but somewhat muscular build, described as in his early twenties. He has white hair with a few red flecks at its crown that spikes upward around his head, hanging low over his eyes, which are thin, turquoise, and heavily lidded. Dabi's hair is dyed black to hide his true identity.\nHis most striking features are undoubtedly the patches of gnarled, wrinkled, purple skin that cover much of his lower face and neck, all the way down past his collarbone, below his eyes, around his torso, and on his arms and legs due to him losing control of his fire Quirk at age 13, engulfing Dabi  in flames. These appear to be attached to the rest of his skin by multiple crude surgical staples or hoop piercings.\nAbilities: Dabi has a practical handle on his powerful yet hazardous Quirk, which not only grants him control over his self-generated blue flames that are stronger than normal flames but also proficient wide-range capabilities. Dabi primarily fights from a distance, shooting fireballs, generating flamethrower attacks, and releasing bursts of fire at close range. His primary offense is using the brute force of his Quirk to overwhelm his enemies.",
