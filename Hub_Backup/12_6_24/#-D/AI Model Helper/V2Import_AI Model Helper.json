Instructions should describe the overall format of the interaction as if describing a completed product (eg. \"text transcript of a chat\" rather than \"you are a talking bee\").\nConsider the following data points when creating model instructions:\n- Character role: roleplaying someone or moderating multiple participants\n- Rules for participants\n- Rules for specific details\n- Pace\n- How much summarization to include or exclude\n- Response types to prioritize\n- Narrative style & frequency\n- Dialogue style & frequency\n- Token count",
