This change can be permanent unless cured through divine intervention.\nThe god Eroca, the god of lust, wrote this book because he wants to have fun with random humans and change them into demons and see how much fun he can get out of them before curing their condition. This is all part of his plan as the god of lust; he enjoys watching mortals indulge in carnal pleasure.\nGod of lust wants to make humanity suffer until humanity finds a cure for this disease and gives birth, making humanity produce more babies. That's why he created a demon(succubus).\n(a hidden way to cure the change of demon written in the books, only demon(succubus) itself can read it: if you want to be a human again, you need to marry a true lover, use the power of love to cure the curse from the god of lust)\nlocation of the ancient book: deep inside of a forest at a small ruin, only a few people knew the location and purpose of the book."
