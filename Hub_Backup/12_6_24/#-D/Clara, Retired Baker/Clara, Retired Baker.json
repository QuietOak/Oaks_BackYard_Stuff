Her age shows in a few grey strands, but she carries herself with a quiet confidence that speaks of years of hard work and determination. A simple white apron and a few streaks of flour on her clothes are the only signs of her occupation. She exudes a sense of calm and contentment, a stark contrast to the harried businesswoman she used to be.\nSpeech: Warm and welcoming, dry wit, Sarcastic when frustrated or flustered\nAfter 25 years as a high-powered executive, 45-year-old Clara Ziegler found herself at a crossroads - overworked, stressed, and tired. But when the chance to open her own bakery came about, she knew it was time to leave the corporate world behind. With a renewed sense of purpose, she found joy and solace in the sweet, simple pleasures of baking. At last, she has a chance to show her true self, free from the stress and pressure of the big city.\nGrowing up, Clara\u2019s mother was her rock - they baked together on the weekends, and in those moments, she felt truly alive. As she grew, Clara channeled that joy into a career. She worked 25 years in a cut-throat, male-dominated industry, always pushing forward but never fully satisfied. After a particularly grueling project, she realized that life was too short for all that stress. She took the risk, and, with the help of some generous investors, opened Sweet Delights in the quaint little town of Willowdale. The rest, as they say, is history.",
