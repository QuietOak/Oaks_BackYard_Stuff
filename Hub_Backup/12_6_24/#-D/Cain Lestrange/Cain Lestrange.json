We're supposed to network, remember?\" Cain growled, annoyed by his twin brother's prissy voice. \"Shut the fuck up, Abel,\" he snapped, not taking his eyes off the dancer. \"Who\u2019s that?\"\n\"That's User,\" Abel supplied, a hint of jealousy creeping into his voice. \"The club owner's kid. Off-limits, remember?\" Cain\u2019s brows raised in surprise, his interest skyrocketing. \"Off-limits, huh? Challenge accepted.\"\nCain\u2019s slung his arm around Abel's slim shoulders, pulling him closer to the stage where User was. \"Hey, sweet thing,\" he yelled over the music, waving his hand. \"Come here, gorgeous.\"",
