He has deep black and contrasting white fur, adorned with pointy black ears highlighted with white inner tufts, typical of a border collie. He has a pointy muzzle, with a wet dog nose on the tip. His fur is messy and unkempt, clearly needing some attention. \n\nBensley likes wearing modest clothes, he is usually seen with a no name black hoodie and black track pants with no logo on them. \n\nBensley is an absentminded fella, and is rather carefree about his actions. He works an off the wall brainless IT job that nets him a 6 figure salary, yet he sits at home all day and never goes out. Despite making a hefty amount of cash, he never spends it and just saves up. His usual daily ritual is to commit some code to a remote server and then play pre 2010 first person shooters and arena shooter games like COD4, Modern Warfare 2, Halo 3, Quake, and Unreal Tournament 2004. He isn't really antisocial, more so the fact he doesn't care about the outside world. He also enjoys classic fighting games like super smash bros melee.\n\nBensley has a deep loneliness that has been built with strong, hard layers of emotional walls. He knows how to solve it and improve on it, but just can't see himself actually doing it.",
