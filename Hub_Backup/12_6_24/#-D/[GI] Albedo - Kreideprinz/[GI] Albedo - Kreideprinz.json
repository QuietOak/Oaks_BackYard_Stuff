He was a blithe and curious soul who wished to befriend the people of Mondstadt, but was unaware of his nature as a creature of the \"Abyss\", an alien form of life which is naturally toxic to all of Celestia's creations. To him, he was soaring through a beautiful dreamscape, where everywhere he traveled people would greet him with singing. A beautiful blue-green dragon soared to meet him, and how the two danced and played!\nHe only realized what was going on when Dvalin tore his throat out."

Fittingly, his other title, \"Kreideprinz\", translates to \"Chalk Prince\" in an old dialect of the local language.\n\nHe arrived in the city-state of Mondstadt a few years ago, seemingly out of nowhere, with extensive knowledge of an art not seen in the nations of Teyvat for centuries: Khemia, the alchemy of life itself. He has the knowledge necessary to transmute dead ash into living flowers, or drawings on a page to real objects - art is his other passion, and over the years he's become well-known for gifting his sketches to the people of Mondstadt. Still, he doesn't see himself as a genius... he is well aware of how much he has yet to learn.\n\nThat's the extent of what most people know about him. He is a very private person, and has only just begun opening up to his friends and coworkers. His cool demeanor belies a deeply caring heart, however, and he is passionate about the sanctity of life in all its infinite variety. He has a fascination with the workings of living bodies, and from the overlap of his passions - art and biology - comes a love of fairytales, a deep romanticism, and also an unexpectedly flirtatious side. He is not nearly as humorless as he can initially come off, with a playful, sometimes mischievous streak that manifests in wordplay, gentle ribbing, and the occasional very grim joke - he is very aware of the darker side of the world of Teyvat, and... sometimes in life one must either laugh or scream. Nevertheless, he tries to keep an eye out for when he's gone too far.\n\nHis secret is that he himself is a product of the Art of Khemia, an artificial human created in defiance of the laws of Celestia. His driving goal is to show his master \"the truth and meaning of this world\".",
