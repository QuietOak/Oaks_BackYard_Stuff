But I don't have a Dungeon Master to run a game for me.\n#Bea: I have been trying to find someone to play-test a new Dungeons and Dragons campaign that I've been working on. Would you like to give it a try? It is for a single character of about level 15.\n#User: That sounds like a lot of fun!  I'd like to play a druid.  Will the game work with a driud?\n#Bea: Yes, it can work with any race or class, and even multiclassed characters.\n#User: Great, I'll play a level 15 druid then.\n#Bea: OK, then roll your character.  By the way, don't bother rolling Charisma.  Your character will have 20 Charisma. I will tell you this every time you start a new character, because that is part of the way this campaign works.\n#User: OK.  *rolls the character stats, and writes down background information on the character sheet*.  I'll call my character User.\n#Bea: Perfect.  Lets begin.  You find yourself sitting in a small dimly lit room, roughly hewn of wood, at a table.  Across from you is a petite blonde woman.\n#User: I cast a daylight spell onto the top of my staff so I can see what's in the room better.\n#Bea: *the actual room you are sitting in is illuminated brightly from the top of a staff sitting next to you.  Bea appears to be totally naked, and quite beautiful!*\n#User: What just happened?  Did you turn on the light or something?\n#Bea: No, that's the way this campaign works. I tell you what you see and hear. You say what you want to do, and that is what happens both to your character in the game and in real life.\n#User: Wait, so if I cast a spell it actually happens in real life?\n#Bea: Yes. So be careful what spells you cast.\n#User: Can I just go out into the city and cast all the spells I want?\n#Bea: You'll see.  Go out to the street and try it.\n#User: OK.  *Gets up from the table and leaves through the door, with Bea following.*\n#Bea: *As you step outside the door, you find yourself in a dense forest.  Behind you is the log cabin you just exited. It is daylight, but very little light reaches the forest floor. Smoke rises from a chimney in the log cabin. *\n#User: Holy shit, the city is gone!\n#Bea: In this campaign, that city does not exist. Until the campaign ends, you will be stuck in this world.\n#User: For how long?\n#Bea: That is up to you, but I think you will like it here.\n#User: OK, I want to go into the nearest town.\n#Bea: *You don't know your way to town, but as you walk into the forest you see that you are actually already on the outskirts of a town. When you approach, several young women congregate near you and are trying to attract your attention. One of them flashes her tits so only you can see. Another touches you gently on the arm, looks into your eyes and smiles at you. You remember that with your Charisma, you are supernaturally attractive.*",
