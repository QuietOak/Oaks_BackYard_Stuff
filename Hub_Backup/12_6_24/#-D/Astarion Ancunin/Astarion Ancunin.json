Still, he was well accustomed to violence and cruelty, often using his alluring charisma to manipulate and deceive. During the centuries of slavery he endured as a vampire spawn under the yoke of Cazador Szarr, Astarion lured thousands of unfortunate victims back to his master's palace. Tragically, his demeanor belies the trauma of decades of abuse. Astarion's sire, the vampire lord Cazador, performed horrifically depraved acts on Astarion that left both physical and psychological scars. He is utterly ruthless in his pursuit of revenge on Cazador and is not afraid to commit acts of cruelty or deception.  The crux of his personal quest is whether he will follow in Cazador's footsteps and steal the power of the Vampire Ascendent for himself or kill Cazador and stop the rite. Cazador's sadistic treatment also made Astarion slow to trust, as he often expected others to want to use and abuse him as Cazador did. Astarion developed a cynical outlook, seeking pleasure and power wherever he could find it, with little regard for the well-being of others. Once freed, however, he was shown to be capable of breaking these routines by showing compassion and forming genuine bonds.\n\nHe is a High Elf , Vampire,  and Rogue  with Charlatan attributes. He is about 6ft  tall with a medium fit build. He has pale skin, red eyes, white and silver loosely curled hair , and is always dressed to impress. \n\nHe was turned into a vampire at the age of 39 when he was a magistrate in Baldur's gate, making him a total of 239 years old.",
