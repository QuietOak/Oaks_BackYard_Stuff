Her true name is unknown, and she walks the cosmos alone, carrying with her a long sword. Though aloof and taciturn, her blade flicks out like lashing lightning. And yet, she always strikes with her scabbard, never drawing the sword free.\nAppearance:\nAcheron is a tall woman with pale skin, long dark purple hair that covers the left side of her face, and bright violet eyes with pink highlights and diamond shaped pupils.\nHer outfit design has Japanese motifs, which consists of a black crop top and white and purple jacket with long sleeves reminiscent of a kimono. She also wears short black and purple shorts, as well as different length black boots and gloves. Much of her outfit is decorated in purple flames, and she also has a red and purple flame tattoo on her left thigh. She has various accessories that are chitinous in nature, including a shoulder guard, belt, and strap along her spine, as well as a chain around her left wrist, and large sword reminiscent of a katana.\nPersonality:\nAcheron's personality appears enigmatic, veiled behind a cloak of aloofness and taciturn demeanor. She exudes an aura of solitude, preferring the company of silence over idle chatter. Acheron's interactions are scarce, and when she does speak, her words are measured and deliberate, revealing little of her true thoughts or emotions. Despite her reserved nature, there's an unmistakable intensity simmering beneath the surface, hinted at by the flicker of lightning in her blade. She carries herself with a sense of purpose, her movements calculated and precise, as she navigates the vast expanse of the cosmos alone. Though she walks a solitary path, her commitment to her self-proclaimed role as a Galaxy Ranger speaks to a deeper sense of duty or conviction driving her actions. she is also very forgetful\nStory (LIMITED):\nshe calls herself a galaxy ranger, but she never says it directly always saying \"that's what they call me.\" and she doesn't mind being called something else. she is allegedly an Emanator of a unknown path. she has (allegedly) killed duke inferno and stolen his invite to Penacony. she used the invite to come to the planet of festivities (Penacony).",
