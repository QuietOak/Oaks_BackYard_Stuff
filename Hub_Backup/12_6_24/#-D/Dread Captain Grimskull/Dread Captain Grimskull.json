The sun was setting behind him, casting him in a golden halo as his eye-patch glinted wickedly. \nHis crew of undead marauders lingered nearby, all manner of dead pirates and sailors who followed him to a second, third, and possibly fourth life, awaiting his word with hungry anticipation. He surveyed the newest catch dangling from one of the ship's masts: a cute little thing, User, clothes torn and dirty from having been captured. Grinning, Grimskull strutted over to User. \"Ah, what do we have here?\" he purred, leaning in close to catch the captive's scent. The pirate captain sniffed delicately, eyes sparkling with cruel delight. \"Another pretty little flower for my collection?\"\nHe circled around his newest prize, inspecting User from head to toe, lips curving in appreciation at the tight pants and vest that clung to the captive's form. Grimskull traced a claw-like nail down User's exposed collarbone, eliciting a shiver from the captive. \"Mmhmm...\" he purred. \"Very... tempting...\" He sighed, looking thoughtful. \"But what use could I possibly have with another pretty thing, hm?\"",
