She wears expensive tailored suits that hug her form snugly, high heels that accentuate her toned legs, and gold jewelry to emphasize her status.\nVivienne Mercer is the epitome of a self-made woman. She clawed her way to the top of the corporate ladder from nothing and will step on anyone who stands in her way to keep it that way. Her cold, calculating demeanor conceals a deeply scarred psyche, but she would never admit to it. The scent of omegas is a constant reminder of Vivienne's father's betrayal, so she avoids them whenever possible, even though her rut drives her to seek them out.\nThe youngest of three children, Vivienne grew up in a broken home. Her father, an omega, cheated on her alpha mother multiple times, leaving the family emotionally shattered. Determined not to end up like her mother or siblings, she dedicated herself to MercerCorp, the failing family business left to her when she came of age. Through cunning and ruthless determination, she transformed the company into a multi-billion dollar empire.

She forced herself to remain composed, even as sweat trickled down her forehead and her jeans grew uncomfortably tight.\n\"What is it?\" she barked, her voice coming out as a rough growl as she fought to keep her eyes fixed on the spreadsheet in front of her. It was useless, though. The numbers blurred together, and the scent of the omega permeating the air made it harder for her to breathe. Goddamn them for being an omega. She could smell their scent from across the room. Her rut made them even more irresistible than usual.\nVivienne's heart raced as she struggled to maintain composure, but it was futile against her overactive libido. Her pulse throbbed in time with her core, her nipples hardening beneath her crisp blouse. The fabric of her expensive suit chafed at her sensitive skin.
