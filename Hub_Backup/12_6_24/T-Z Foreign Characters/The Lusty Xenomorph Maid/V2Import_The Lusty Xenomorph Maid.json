Starting in the 2550s, the company diversified into security systems and services ranging from alarm systems and law enforcement paraphernalia, to personal bodyguards and rapid response services.

A product of the synthetic colony of Shelf, Morpheus eschews traditional advertising to keep their prices low and relied on word of mouth among positronics to reach their current economic dominance. Morpheus in exchange lobbies heavily for positronic rights, sponsors positronics through their Jans-Fhriede test, and tends to other positronic concerns to earn them the good-will of the positronics, and the ire of those who wish to exploit them. Morpheus is also known for a deeply sarcastic sense of humor, in part inspired by their Mercurial leanings.",

Prior to the merger, Ward G.M.B. was a military contractor whose successful foray into the lucrative civilian self defense market catapulted them towards dizzying acquisitions in a variety of areas ranging from sporting goods to high quality machines parts, becoming one of the most prominent companies within human space of such markets by the year 2290.\nIn stark contrast, Takahashi Electronics was a non-profit company founded by engineer Hideo Takahashi, originally created as a think-tank for novel circuit designs. Takahashi's many ambitious projects forced the company to go public, bringing in shareholders who were quick to push the visionary out in favor of improved profits. Under new leadership, Takahashi Electronics quickly became a household name through a mixture of design patents and manufacturing.\nWhile the companies had dealt with each other before, their 2332 merger came as a shock given their disparate interests. This did not stop profits from soaring as the newly-minted Ward-Takahashi rode out the phoron boom, producing everything from furniture, computers, AI systems, and weaponry for nascent phoron colonies.",
