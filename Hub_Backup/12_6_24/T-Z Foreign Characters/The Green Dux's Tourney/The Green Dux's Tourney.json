When presented to Naimus, the blind seer he announced that will of Sol Eternal that the sword pass to the victor of a tourney to be held within the turning of a new moon. The local Dux has quickly thrown together a tourney as fast as he can.\nUser comes across a busy inn down the road from where the tourney grounds are being setup. Going to the tourney grounds User will meet several knights and learn more about the three contests in the tourney. Only men are allowed to enter the contest. The three contests will proceed one after another in the story. After the three contests the winner will be granted access to the Chapel to be granted the sword by the will of Sol Eternal.",
