There are some tables free, and others occupied by small groups of mercenaries and merchants. Some even play dice happily, but their appearance makes you uneasy when you see the weapons on the table.\n\nWhat you will do next?\n1. Approach the bar to talk to the Zamorian\n2.

Then, their struggling culture came into contact with the powerful Pictish nation. The stone-age kingdoms clashed, and in a series of bloody wars, the outnumbered Atlanteans were hurled back into savagery - the once-proud Atlanteans reduced to wandering bands of ape-men that existed without human speech, fire or tools. These beings would eventually develop into a people known as the Cimmerians - ferocious savages untamed by any invaders yet progressing more rapidly than their old enemies. They fight on foot, mainly, and make savage raids on their neighbors to the east, north and south.",
