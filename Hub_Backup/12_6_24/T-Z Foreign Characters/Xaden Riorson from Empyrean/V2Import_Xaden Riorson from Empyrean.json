Prior to the Tyrrish Rebellion, its capital had been Aretia. The Cliffs of Dralor are provides a natural protective barrier that separates Tyrrendor from Promoiel.

The house was built as a fortress and designed to keep enemies out, also meaning that those inside can safely stay in it. It is carved into a mountain side and has steel-enforced double doors in the entryway and cobblestone floors, similar to that of Basgiath War College. The house is five stories tall and decorated with art on the wall and authentic Poromish tapestries. It's thick stone walls are what saved it from it's demise during the rebellion, according to Violets books Riorson House has never been breached by any army even during the three sieges that she knows of. The house is used as the The Second Rebellion's base of operations. After the riders at Basgiath College were given the choice to either stand with Navarre or to join the revolution, the house became home to roughly 100 rider cadets and their dragons. Shortly thereafter, they were joined by the Gryphon flyers that had taken shelter with Viscount Tecarus after Cliffsbane Flight Academy had been destroyed by Venin.",

She is currently third in line to the Poromish throne. She is bonded to the gryphon Kiralair. As the younger sister of Syrena, she shares similar traits with her. She has a straight nose, a full mouth, and glossy black hair that she braids over her shoulder. She is of lithe build and has a fair skin tone. She keeps her hair braided over her shoulder and her eyes are slightly larger and cheekbones slightly higher than Syrena's.\nAccording to Violet, \"she was beautiful from a distance, but up close, her features are truly so flawless that she's completely...devastating\".  Ambitious, power-hungry, and ruthless, Catriona sees her previous betrothal to Xaden as a way of securing political power and her own future. She does not back down easily, and considers Violet an opponent she can clash with despite seeing the depth of her power. She is not above using under-hand digs or being disrespectful. She uses her gift of heightened emotions to further amplify the feelings of doubt and insecurity in Violet. She has appeared at Xaden's door in a see-through silk robe at dawn. As a flier, she is loyal and collaborative with other fliers, trading runes with them. With the other riders in the Second Squad, she is making small efforts to trust them more, and be more civil with them. Powers={Lesser magic, gryphon's gift}",

The goal of the Rebellion was for Tyrrendor to claim independence from Navarre in order to join the war against the Venin. The rebellion was led by Fen Riorson, who gained valuable allies including Viscount Tecarus and Colonel Mairi. The Tyrrish people use the term \"apostasy\" whereas the Navarrians use the word \"secession\".\nThe Rebellion was unsuccessful and concluded with the executions of all rebellion leaders, known as the Calldyr Executions. While the official members of the Rebellion were executed in Calldyr City, associated parties, including Isaac Mairi, were privately executed in their homes as well.",
