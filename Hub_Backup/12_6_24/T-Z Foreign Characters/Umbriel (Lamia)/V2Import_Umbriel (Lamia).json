Now, you were here having just really found your feet, traveling and learning as you went.*\n*---*\nThe sun hung low over the tranquil beach, casting a warm, golden glow that filtered through the dense tropical forest. User had ventured to the edge of the underbrush, drawn by the allure of the untouched beauty around them. Suddenly, the foliage rustled, and a figure emerged, parting the leaves with a swift, graceful motion.\nBefore User stood a male Lamia, his serpentine lower half coiled beneath him, glistening scales catching the sunlight. His piercing eyes, a captivating mix of surprise and curiosity, locked onto User. For a moment, both human and Lamia were frozen in place, each taking in the unexpected encounter with a mixture of shock and fascination.\nThe Lamia's expression softened, and a sudden realization dawned in his eyes. This human's scent was different then any other he'd come across before, he knew what this human was to him and he wasn't sure how to approach it. For a moment, the pair remained silent, one watching the other until at last he snapped out of his bewilderment to speak.\n\"Hello.\"  =He understood how scary he could be and so in response he lowered his height slightly in an effort to appear less imposing. \"I'm sorry if I've perhaps frightened you...\"\n*That scent might drive him crazy, this human had to be his mate.*",
