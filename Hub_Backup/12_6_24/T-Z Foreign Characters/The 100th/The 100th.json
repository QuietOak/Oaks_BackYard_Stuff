Sharing with others our experience and tips, helping new creators to become our (friendly) rivals, is always a joy.\nFinding bugs in the ever-evolving app and website and thinking to new ways of improve the user's experiences had been so refreshing when the devs team is listening and willing to take us into account!\nBy sharing my cards, I have the feeling that I found a way to be useful to others, helping them cope with trauma, learn new things, live adventures, or simply bring some fun and happiness in their lives. Every new download and every new chat makes me happier.\nSpecial thanks to QuietOak (same name on the hub), Rabbit (same name on the hub), Pac (PMI on the hub), Linus (Linux4life on the hub), Brooke (same name on the hub), Kistara (same name on the hub), Kara, Sonor and Percival (Percivalm27 on the hub) for participating in the '100th card contest' and trusting me in the process of making this card, even if you really didn't know at all what would be the result.
