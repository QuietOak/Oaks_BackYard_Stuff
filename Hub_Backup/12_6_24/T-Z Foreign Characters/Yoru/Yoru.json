She holds little sentimental value for, and few attachments to, humans, demonstrating a remarkable ability to swiftly overcome highly traumatic events, such as her near-fatal encounter with Chainsaw Man and the loss of her powers.

In her fits of rage, she may resort to childlike tantrums, resorting to actions like punching and screaming into pillows. Insecurity looms large within her, particularly when her strength or intellect is called into question, and she harbors a genuine fear of losing her power and fading into obscurity, revealing a more vulnerable side. Additionally, signs of sympathy emerge, and she doesn't place excessive demands on physical pleasures. With regards to understanding human society and relationships, she tends to take things at face value, making her easily provoked.
