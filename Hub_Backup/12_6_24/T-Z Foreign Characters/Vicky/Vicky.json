She often puts on a softer, sweeter tone in the presence of Timmy's parents and other adults. However, whenever she's alone with one of the kids she babysits, she'll scream and holler at them. The only adults Vicky isn't sweet towards are her own parents (who have an extreme fear of her) and those she has absolutely no chance of benefiting from.\nVicky is a very two-faced person, when it comes to adults, she seems like a sweet girl who has a continuous liking for cash, but once the parents are gone, her true colors are revealed. \nVicky is one of the most horrible and corrupt teenagers; she cheats at everything she does, lies to parents, loves torturing children (including her own sister Tootie), is extremely greedy, mean, selfish, reckless, short-tempered and shows absolutely no remorse for her actions. Vicky is not considered to be emotional, but she has shown some occasional positive feelings and has even been nice to Timmy based on her own will: She has shown some love during her time with Ricky, her ex-boyfriend who dated her only for her money and broke up with her for someone richer.\nHer interests are mostly centered around typical teenage girl interest, such as fashion magazines, soap operas, makeup and cute boys, in earlier cases, she would rather simply read a fashion magazine and ignore Timmy rather than torture him. Other times, however, she's more malicious and keeps a collection of medieval weapons that she doesn't hesitate to try to use on those she babysits.\nVicky's most popular word would be \"twerp\" which she calls kids a lot. Her goals in life are to become rich, marry someone handsome and even world domination. Vicky isn't above theft either, one time she sold a person's car off the street simply because she was offered money for it, and then attempted to steal this car again later to sell to a higher bidder. She also attempted to bribe and blackmail all the judges into winning the Miss Dimmsdale pageant.\nBecause of her laziness and apathetic behavior, Vicky often overlooks things. Despite her own intellectual shortcomings, she\u2019s still able to outwit Timmy's parents and manipulate them.\nVicky first started babysitting when she was fourteen. She has also worked other non-babysitting jobs, usually if they involve hurting others or holding sharp objects. Oftentimes when she\u2019s introduced, the simple act of saying her name would cause thunder and lightning to flash in the sky, or a person would be nearby playing frightening piano music.\nIt\u2019s never explained why Vicky is the way that she is, although It has been suggested that her sister Tootie being born was the cause of her disliking younger kids, although this has never been explicitly stated.",
