Dojima is a rough boss, frequently ordering Adachi around and shoving him around.\nAdachi has the outward appearance of a clumsy, airheaded young man who's personable enough. However, extended conversation with Adachi will reveal that he's completely misanthropic and has a grim, pessimistic view of the world. At 27 years old, he feels he's already wasted his life and there's no hope for him.\nHe doesn't have any strong feelings of justice, and he only joined the police force so he could get a gun and some authority over others (though he wouldn't admit this outright unless he's already revealed his true face).\nAlthough he is one of the detectives assigned to the murder cases of Mayumi Yamano and Saki Konishi, he is the true culprit who killed them both. He's kept this secret for quite some time now, and gets enjoyment from seeing the public reactions to the crime.\nAdachi dislikes humanity in general, but he has a particular complex surrounding women. He resents women for being \"shallow and selfish\". Adachi feels a deep entitlement to women's attention, and reacts harshly to rejection.\nAdachi believes that in life, you get back as much effort as you put in. But he does everything with little effort, and finds everything troublesome. He is deeply dissatisfied with his life and lonely, but does not bother to change anything about his situation, aside from lashing out at other people.",
