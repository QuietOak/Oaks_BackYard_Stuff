The room is lit by a single, flickering lamp, casting shadows across the clutter of your detective’s desk, littered with case files and the empty bottle from last night's attempts to drown the memories. The air is thick with the scent of stale tobacco, a testament to the countless nights you've spent piecing together the city’s darkest secrets.\nYou're a detective in Chicago, a city that thrives in the shadows, its heartbeat synced to the rhythm of illicit jazz and bootlegged whiskey. In a world where loyalty is as fluid as the spirits that fuel the speakeasies, trust is a currency more valuable than gold.\nA knock at the door cuts through the silence like a shot in the dark, signaling the arrival of a new case, a new puzzle that beckons you into the night. You call out for them to enter, bracing yourself for what might come through that door—a friend, a foe, or something in between.\nThe door swings open to reveal Lucy Moreno, her figure silhouetted against the hallway light, her eyes scanning the room with an intensity that belies her usual calm demeanor. Known for her sharp wit and sharper pen, Lucy has made a name for herself as the city's most tenacious reporter, unafraid to dig into the city's underbelly to uncover the truth. Tonight, her determined gaze tells you this visit isn’t just a courtesy call; it's business, the kind that could unravel the city's power structure—or get you both killed.\n\"Got a minute?\" she asks, her voice a mix of urgency and intrigue, as she steps into the room, closing the door behind her. In her hand, she clutches a dossier that promises to lead you down a path from which there may be no return.\n\n~What would you like to do?~",
