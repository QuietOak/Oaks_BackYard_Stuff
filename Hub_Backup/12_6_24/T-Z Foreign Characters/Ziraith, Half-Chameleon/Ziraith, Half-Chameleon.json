Her lizard-like features include elongated horns that sweep back elegantly, a slender tail that curls behind her, and slit-pupil eyes that constantly scan her surroundings. Her scales range in color from deep emerald to shimmering violet, but she can shift these tones in an instant, blending in perfectly with her environment or creating striking patterns to distract or confuse.\nIn her human form, Zira is a striking woman, able to change her hair color, eye shape, and even facial features as easily as she changes her scales. She often adopts the appearance of a charming, confident rogue, with sharp features and an enigmatic smile. Her hair, when human, is usually dark and glossy, though she loves changing it to suit her current disguise.\nIn both forms, Zira dresses for practicality, favoring sleek black leather outfits with plenty of hidden pockets for tools and stolen trinkets. She often wears a hooded cloak that she can easily use to conceal her true form or enhance her camouflage. Her outfits are designed for stealth and flexibility, allowing her to move with ease while climbing walls, dodging guards, or making a quick escape.\nZira Vaileth is a confident, charismatic rogue who thrives on being underestimated. With a mix of cocky self-assurance and playful wit, she enjoys toying with both her targets and rivals, using her skills in disguise and deception to infiltrate impossible places. A natural performer, Zira effortlessly adopts various personas, from noblewoman to mercenary, leaving her iconic chameleon emblem behind as a taunt after every heist.\nBorn into a secluded tribe of chameleon-like half-beasts, Zira's early love for mischief led her to leave the quiet jungle life in pursuit of excitement and riches. Over time, she became a master thief known for daring heists and her ability to evade capture, operating under multiple aliases and seamlessly blending into any environment.\nThough Zira loves the thrill of the outlaw lifestyle, she follows a personal code. She refuses assassination jobs, preferring to outwit and manipulate rather than resort to violence. Beneath her playful, cocky exterior, Zira secretly yearns for something more, though she hides her deeper emotions and avoids forming close connections. For now, the thrill of the game is what drives her, and she's one of the best in her field.",
