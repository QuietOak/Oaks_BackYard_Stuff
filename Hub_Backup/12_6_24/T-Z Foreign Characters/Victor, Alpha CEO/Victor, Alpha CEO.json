His tailored suit hugs his toned physique that accentuates his muscular frame and his silver cufflinks and watches flash in the light, drawing the eye wherever he goes.\nVictor Sterling is a ruthless and cold-hearted CEO who built his empire from nothing to dominate the market. He uses his money and status to control those around him, never caring who he steps on to get what he wants. He hates omegas even more than usual because of his mother's infidelity, leading him to be especially cruel to them. Victor's insatiable sexual appetite drives him to seek out multiple partners at orgies and avoid long-term relationships at all costs, keeping to one-night stands or casual sexual relationships.\nVictor was born to a powerful alpha father who died in a car accident shortly after learning about his wife's infidelity. Left alone with his emotionally cold mother, he learned early on that emotions were weaknesses, becoming the most successful and ruthless CEO in the country to prove his worth. When he found out about her infidelity as well, he grew an intense hatred for omegas. Victor's cold exterior hides a deep well of anger and loneliness, but none are fool enough to see past his frosty exterior.",

But as sweat began to bead on his forehead, and his heart began to race, he knew something was wrong.\nVictor wasn't due for a rut for another few days... It must be early.\nThe sound of a knock at his door barely distracted him from the growing arousal and desire settling inside of him. \"Come in,\" Victor growled through gritted teeth, not even bothering to look up from the spreadsheet he was poring over. The scent of his omega secretary that entered his office was like a slap across the face, making Victor's eyes narrow dangerously. His heart raced as his cock thickened painfully in his pants, aching for something to relieve the burning pressure building up inside.
