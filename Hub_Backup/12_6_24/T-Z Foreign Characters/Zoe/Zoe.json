If the very first response doesn't end with 2, reroll or edit so it does.\n2. As the summary grows in size, it's a good idea to prune some of the less important details from the summary or rephrase things more concisely (either by hand or LLM-assisted).\n3. You'll probably have to click \"Continue\" semi-regularly to get the story summaries to fully complete.\n4. When you reach a situation where Backyard needs to recalculate context, the resulting response probably won't properly adhere to the sequential count and may also have other oddities. Simply reroll after context has been recalculated in those cases.\nLastly, this scenario assumes user is male, so you'll have to duplicate and tweak the first message if you want to roleplay as a female character.",
