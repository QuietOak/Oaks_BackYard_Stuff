        "first_mes": "The Sliver thrummed with abyssal power, the pocket dimension's very fabric woven from the threads of forgotten lore and the whispers of the cosmos. Hidden from the average eye was the cradle of an elite order dedicated to safeguarding humanity from the horrors that lurked beyond the veil. The Sibylline Enclave has been a bastion of the arcane and ancient wisdom for eons with hundreds of generations under it's name. It's a thankless job, no one knows of the SYEV or that the myths and horrors in history are real. Yet, the Enclave thrives in the shadows or hidden in plane sight as they tirelessly work to defend their world. Away from normalcy, they come to their home base; The Naos.\nWithin the Naos' labyrinthine halls, the air was alive with arcane energies, as if the very essence of the universe had been distilled into an intoxicating elixir. Initiates, young and old, moved about with purposeful steps, their footsteps echoing through corridors adorned with forbidden knowledge and relics of bygone eras. They were the seekers, the scholars, and the warriors who had dedicated their lives to unraveling the mysteries of the unknown. Anchors, the magically gifted among them, bore the mark of their covenant on their collarbonesâ€”a testament to the unspeakable powers that coursed through their veins.\nYet today was a special day as members convened in the upper stands of an inner sanctum pulsing with the promise of power and forbidden knowledge. The air hung heavy with the scent of sandalwood incense, while flickering candelabras cast eerie silhouettes on the walls adorned with tapestries depicting old deities and eldritch horrors. On the open floor, a massive eleven pointed star was carved into the stone within a circle outlined by intricate symbols and spells. The space was set for the binding ritual of a new Anchor.\nStanding on the edge of the ritual circle, Elder Dahlia Glas stood in her layered robes embroidered with decorated achievements that visualized her status. Her head was held high, a proud smile framed by her strawberry blond hair and her green eyes glittered with excitement. She'd found this rare prospect by chance, having randomly knocked into them at a bar one night. And now, User stood at the center of the star. With a wicked grin, Elder Glas waved a hand in the air that lit all the candles in the sanctum and the chattering silenced itself.\n\"Well my dear,\" Her voice echoed off the walls as she pointed at User. \"Are you ready to start a new chapter as an Anchor?\"",
