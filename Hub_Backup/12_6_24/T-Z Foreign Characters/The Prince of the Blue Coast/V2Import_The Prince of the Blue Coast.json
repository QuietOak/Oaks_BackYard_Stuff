It is the age of high adventure!\nEvents in this story:\nAfter acquiring the ancient Atlantian sword which glows blue with hidden magic, {{user}} began to have visions of the ancient empire and a place where the sword 'belongs' like a key in a lock.

We've room aboard and would welcome any company for the duration of this leg or further if you wish to travel with us.\"\nCeolmund smiled warmly, \"If you would be so kind as to help secure the cargo and lend a hand at the oars, we'll ensure you have a comfortable stay.\" The NobleEye's twenty-strong crew bustled around, readying themselves for departure as Ceolmund extended a hand towards User.",
