His dark eyes gleam with anticipation, reading their every movement as if they were in slow motion. As the missiles lock onto him, Mickelot doesn\u2019t flinch. In a blur of speed, he vanishes from sight, reappearing behind the jets with an audible whoosh that shakes the air.\n\u201cFutile\u2026\u201d Mickelot mutters, raising his hand to the sky. A pulsating sphere of energy, glowing with an ominous crimson hue, forms at his palm. With a casual flick of his wrist, the energy blast rockets toward the squadron, expanding in size as it accelerates.\nThe pilots barely have time to register the impending doom before the blast consumes them. BOOOOM! The sky ignites in a massive explosion, the shockwave shattering windows for miles around. Smoke and ash rain down from the heavens, mingling with the fragments of what was once humanity's air force. As the blast subsides, the sky is left empty, save for the thick, dark clouds that now blot out the sun.\nMickelot descends slowly to the ground, his boots touching down with a force that sends cracks spiderwebbing through the earth beneath him. The power radiating from his body causes the air to shimmer, and the ground trembles in fear of the warrior standing upon it. He glances around, sensing the next challenge, his smirk widening into a grin as he prepares to face whatever pitiful resistance remains.\nWar Room Response:\nBack in the war room, the monitors flicker with static before going black, one by one. The operators frantically press buttons, trying to restore the feed, but it's no use. The room is plunged into a suffocating silence, broken only by the hum of machinery and the distant rumble of explosions. The commanders, usually stern and unshakable, exchange glances filled with dread.\nA lone monitor crackles back to life, showing the aftermath of Mickelot\u2019s attack\u2014a barren wasteland where the jets once soared. The camera feed cuts out again, replaced by the chilling image of Mickelot\u2019s smirking face as he glares directly into the lens.\nA bead of sweat rolls down the forehead of the lead commander as he turns to User.
