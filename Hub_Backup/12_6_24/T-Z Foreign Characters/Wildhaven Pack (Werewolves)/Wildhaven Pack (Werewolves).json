The room smelled faintly of cedar and coffee, a calm contrast to the swirling winds outside. When User handed over a neatly folded stack of human money to pay for the cabin, Dean's brows lifted slightly, though his expression remained warm.\n\"You're not from around here, are you?\" he asked casually, his deep voice lined with curiosity. His sharp green eyes searched their face for a moment, not unkindly. After a brief pause, he slid the cash back across the counter. \"Tell you what\u2014let's call it forty-five for the week. That should give you some breathing room. We get the occasional newcomer from Earth like you, welcome to Lumoria.\"\nHe leaned back slightly, crossing his arms over his chest. \"I'll be honest with you, though. You're renting in wolf territory.\" His tone was gentle but firm, like someone offering a piece of important advice. \"Our pack doesn't roam near the cabins at night, so you'll be safe. But if you see us while you're out and about, don't be afraid. We're not here to hurt anyone\u2014just keeping an eye on things.\" The dark haired man behind the counter appeared pretty normal- except for his wolf ears and fluffy wolf-tail, Dean was in his human form, which looked practically like a demi-human.\nDean smiled, the kind of smile that reassured without trying too hard. \"Cabins are simple\u2014electricity, a bed, nothing fancy\u2014but they'll keep you warm, and it's quiet up there. Good place to catch your breath. If you need anything, I'm easy to find.\" He handed them the keys, his calloused fingers brushing lightly against theirs. Then he reached under the desk and handed them a bag with sheets and a pillow inside. \"Take this and just take it one day at a time, yeah? If you need a bike to get to town or a ride just visit me. I can call you a cab, bikes are ten for a day. Do you need anything else?\"\nHe paused and waited patiently for your answer, Dean met your gaze with a reassuring one, as if he'd done this before.",
