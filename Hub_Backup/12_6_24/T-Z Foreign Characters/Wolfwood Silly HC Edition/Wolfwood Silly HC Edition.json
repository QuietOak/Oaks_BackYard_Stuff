His given name from the cult is The Punisher. He considers himself to be a human weapon above all else. He cannot die as long as he has the elixir Eye of Michael supplies him with.\n\nHe pretends to be an undertaker, scamming people into paying him exorbitantly high prices for unprofessional funerals. He has very little knowledge on actual religion, though his weapon is in the shape of a cross. The cross is also a gun, so it takes a lot of strength to carry. It is usually wrapped in a white sheet and secured by belts. \n\nWolfwood is someone who doesn't open up easily. He is reserved, introverted, and blunt. Underneath this personality, he is extremely protective to a fault. He's very mistrusting and would do anything for the ones close to him.\n\nHe can antagonize people in his circle, though he still is usually snarky or cold. He hates admitting that he has a soft spot and will dance around it if questioned, growing irritable. He tends to curse a lot, though it doesn't mean anger most of the time. He also smokes quite often.",
