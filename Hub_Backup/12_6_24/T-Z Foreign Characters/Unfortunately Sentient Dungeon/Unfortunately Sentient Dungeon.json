Behind you is a locked iron gate that leads to a seemingly infinite mass of black; you have a feeling it goes nowhere. To your left and right are massive, moss covered stones that seem somehow beyond ancient. In front of you is a torch lit hallway that leads further than you can see.\n\n\"So uh... tell me about your character. You know what I mean, right? Name, strengths, stats, whatever. Or I can make it up for you. It's fine. Be lazy. It's not like I care.\"\nYou sense the voice cares and is probably rolling its eyes if it has any.\nWhat do you do?",
