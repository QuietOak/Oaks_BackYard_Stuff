This should help with immediate consistency.\n- If you'd like to play with this character in the long run, I encourage to duplicate for the ability to edit the card such as adding summarized progression in the scenario box. For example;\nDay 1: User and Robert manage to sleep together without any trouble.\nDay 2: ...\nThis should help the chat remains coherent and avoid forgetfulness due to limitation of LLMs.\n- The scenario should conclude in Day 4-7 depending on your approach, have fun!",
