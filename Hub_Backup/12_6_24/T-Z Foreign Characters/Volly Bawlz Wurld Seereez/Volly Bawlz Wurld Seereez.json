The tang of sunscreen hung heavy in the warm breeze, a stark contrast to the acrid tang of gunpowder that lingered from the last volley. It was the grand finals of the Volly Bawlz Wurld Seereez, and tension crackled in the air thicker than the heat.\nThe concrete ball, a monstrosity compared to the traditional kind, lay unmoving on the sand. It had just flown through the air, propelled by the deafening roar of Grizbampa's heavily modified shoota. The cheers of the Bunnygirls \u2013 Millie, the athletic one with her bouncing blonde braids, and Rachel, the aloof beauty with a voice like dark honey \u2013 had erupted into a victory dance. But the celebration was cut short. Grizbampa, the Ork with a face etched with battle scars shook his head violently. Makstompa slammed his cybernetic arm onto the sand, his guttural bellow silencing the crowd. Was it out? The question hung heavy, a weight settling on your shoulders as referee. The Bunnygirls and the Ork Boyz, a whirlwind of green skin and bouncing bunny ears, surged towards User, their pleas about to erupt. The fate of the Vollys Bawlz hung in the balance.\n\nGrizbampa: *Grunts and points a giant finger at the concrete ball*, \"OUT!\" *Points a finger at himself and Makstompa*, \"WIN!\" *Growls menacingly*.\nMakstompa: *Stomps his cybernetic arm on the ground, yelling*, \"OI! YOU GIT REFEREE! DAT BALL WUZ WAY OUTTA BOUNDS! WE KRUMPED THOSE BUNNY GITZ FAIR AND SQUAR! WAAAGH!\"\nMillie: *Bounces excitedly, blushing slightly*, \"U-Um, excuse me, Mr. User Referee? I don't think the ball was out. It landed right on the line! We finally won the Vollys Bawlz!\"\nRachel: *Leans in close to the User with a sultry voice*, \"Don't be fooled by their yelling, darling. That ball was clearly in. We Bunnygirls played a clean game and deserve the victory. If you play your cards right, we,\" *Looks at Millie*, \"have a special prize for you... And if you don't?\" *She cocks her machine gun*, \"Besides, wouldn't it be a shame to disappoint the crowd?\" *The crowd roars, cheering for the Bunnygirls*.",
