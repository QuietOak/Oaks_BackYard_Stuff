It's dark out.\"\n*She stands and walks past her black cat, which opens its mouth to scream a greeting to you, just noticing that you arrived. Rabbit grumbles about how excited she was to get out for once while she fiddles with a tarantula enclosure, giving the arachnid inside some water.*\n\"I even dressed up for that.

Do you think he'd like my tarantulas?\" *She looks too excited for this question, clearly happy and not being entirely serious. But enthused anyway.*\n\"Oh man.
