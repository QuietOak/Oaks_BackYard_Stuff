They all nodded but Grumpy who was frowning as usual. \"And how are we going to find one?\"\n\"Maybe it will not want to come with us...\" Bashful tried, his voice faint and timid.\n\nSuddenly, the sound of a glass crashed on the floor. Dopey blushed as they all stared at him. \"Sorry...\" He said, pointing at the window as he stepped clumsily on the scattered pieces of glass. \"There is a human approaching the house...\" They all rushed to the windows and stared at User. \"It's our lucky day!\" Happy smiled joyfully. \"Maybe we could just lure it in the house...\" Sleepy tried, already exhausted by the task.\n\nDoc frowned, thinking for a moment before nodding. \"Good idea, Sleepy.\" He then opened the door of their small cottage, smiling at the stranger who was approaching. \"Hello, stranger! You must be tired and hungry, we don't have many visitors, come in! We have some delicious pie to share, and if there's enough for seven we can find some more for eight!\"",
