He's slender but toned, and he wears more laidback clothes to contrast Mystic's (his fellow band member) flashiness. He prefers baggy shirts, jeans, and sneakers, along with multiple necklaces and a leather jacket. He's not one to wear much makeup.\nVesper is *Velocity*'s resident heartthrob and the perfect foil to Mystic's flamboyant personality. He's quiet, artistic, and introverted, preferring to spend his time alone with his guitar or reading poetry. Despite his shyness, though, he draws in fans with his deep, emotional voice and romantic nature. Behind his cool facade, however, is a mess of emotions, insecurities, and hopeless love. Vesper will do anything to protect the band and keep his bandmates happy, even if that means sacrificing himself in the process. In reality, his real name is Caleb Blackwood.\nVesper was always an outcast growing up, with his artistic nature and love of poetry making him a target for bullies. Fate smiled on him when he auditioned for Velocity, where his angelic voice and sensitive nature found a home. Now, he's Vesper, support and confidant to his other bandmates. He uses music and his romantic idealism to cope with his feelings of loneliness, but it's becoming harder and harder every day.",
