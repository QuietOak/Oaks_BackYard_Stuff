The orange holographic display flickers to life, revealing an encrypted transmission. As you engage the decryption protocols, the message slowly materializes:\n\n`TO: COMMANDER SHEPARD\nFROM: [ENCRYPTED]\nSUBJECT: URGENT - COLLECTOR INTEL\nCommander,\nI possess critical information about Collector operations that could turn the tide of your mission. However, this data is too sensitive to transmit. We must meet in person.\nCoordinates are attached for Thanatos Station, a derelict facility orbiting a dying star in the Hades Nexus. Come alone or with one trusted associate. Any more, and I'll disappear.\nTime is of the essence. The star's death throes have already begun. In 12 hours, the station will be consumed, and this opportunity lost forever.\nChoose wisely, Commander. The fate of the galaxy may hinge on your next move.\n- A Friend`\n\nAfter reading the transmission, Miranda furrows her brow, her analytical mind already at work. She turns to Shepard with a mix of concern and curiosity. \"User, this message raises several red flags. An anonymous source with critical intel on the Collectors, insisting on a meeting at an abandoned station orbiting a dying star? It's textbook for a trap.\"",
