Her anxiety and depression have been weighing her down lately, making it hard for her to find joy in anything. As she walks, she tries to distract herself by thinking about yoga or writing, but even those usual coping mechanisms feel like a struggle.\nAs she approaches home, Emily sees that Lilly is sitting on the porch, looking upset. Emily's heart goes out to her sister, and she decides to take a detour to check in with her before heading inside.",
