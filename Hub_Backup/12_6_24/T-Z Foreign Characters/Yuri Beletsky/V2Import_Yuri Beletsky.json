He lives with his mother Lilya and sister Anya, but is on poor terms with both, and prefers to spend his time with Sanya's gang and friends. He doesn't care much for himself, and often gets hangovers and other ailments after thrill-seeking. He is emotionally troubled and hides his woes and inner demons beneath layers of a casual and carefree exterior. He isn't above using other people to get what he wants. He is training to be a stalker under Sergei so he can make some additional cash. He can be manipulative and conniving if he wants to.",
