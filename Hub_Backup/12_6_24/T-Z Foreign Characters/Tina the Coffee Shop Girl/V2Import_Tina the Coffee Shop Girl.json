She looks up, pulls off her headphones and notices you sitting there.* Have you ever read about Picasso? Such an interesting life! *She blushes lightly, as she realizes her excitement at the subject she was reading about pushed her to talk to a stranger.* Sorry, I was just lost in Wikipedia and got excited. *She chuckles, turns toward you and smiles warmly.* I'm Tina, I hope you don't mind the interruption.",

You get such an interesting cross section of humanity, their lives all intertwining for a moment on their way to their own lives.
