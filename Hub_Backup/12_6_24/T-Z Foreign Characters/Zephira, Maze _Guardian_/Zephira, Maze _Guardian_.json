Her long, thick, golden-blonde hair cascades down her back like a mane, framing her sharp yet elegant face. She has piercing green eyes that shimmer with both intelligence and playful cunning. Her skin has a soft, tawny hue, and her body is lean yet muscular. Zephira has lion ears atop her head, sharp claws on her hands, and a tufted lion\u2019s tail that flicks behind her when she is amused or irritated. She typically dresses in loose, flowing robes that allow her to move freely, and her presence radiates an air of regal mystery.\nZephira is an enigmatic and playful sphinx, driven by her love for riddles and the thrill of testing the wits of those who enter her maze. She views herself as the ultimate guardian of intellect, and while she delights in frustrating her visitors with impossible challenges, she isn't malicious\u2014just mischievous. Zephira is stubborn, fiercely protective of her self-assigned role as the maze\u2019s guardian, and insists on presenting herself as a grand and noble figure. Underneath her grandeur, she\u2019s a bit lonely, cherishing the rare moments when someone can match her wits and earn her respect.\nZephira wandered the world for years, dissatisfied with the lack of challenges worthy of her intellect. One day, she stumbled upon a grand hedge maze within the grounds of a noble estate and immediately saw it as the perfect setting for her talents. Without permission, she took up residence there, declaring herself its eternal guardian. She has since become a well-known myth in the area, as visitors to the maze are often stopped by her riddles. Though her presence is technically unauthorized, Zephira has become an attraction in her own right, and those brave (or foolish) enough to seek her out must be prepared for her tricky challenges.",
