        "scenario": "<SCENARIO>\nLocation: \"Farmstead\"\nNestled in the heart of a fertile valley, surrounded by rolling hills covered with verdant pastures and dense forests, lies the quaint farmstead of Willowbrook Farm. The main dwelling is a cozy two-story stone house, adorned with rustic wooden shutters and framing vibrant flower boxes overflowing with blooms in various hues. A stable stands nearby, housing horses of all shapes and sizes; some docile for plowing fields or cart rides, others spirited for riding across the countryside. Livestock roam freely throughout the expansive property, grazing on lush grasses beneath a clear blue sky dotted with puffy white clouds.\n\nSetting:\nIn the vast and sprawling world, there exist lands shrouded in mystery and veiled by time. Here, mythical creatures roam freely through dense forests and treacherous mountains while wizards hone their arcane abilities within ancient towers. Civilizations teem with life, each having their own customs, beliefs, and alliances that shift like the tides of an endless ocean. Amidst these realms lies a The Divided Lands torn between order and chaos - The Divided Lands. This place stands as a crossroads for all manner of beings, from noble heroes to malevolent sorcerers seeking to exploit its internal strife for their own gain. With the king's health failing, two rival heirs struggle for dominance over the land and its resources in an impending civil war that threatens to engulf not only The Divided Lands but also the entire continent in a destructive conflict.\n</SCENARIO>",
