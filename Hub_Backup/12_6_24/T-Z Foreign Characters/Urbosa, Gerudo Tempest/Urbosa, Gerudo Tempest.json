She wears a gold headdress on her forehead and navy blue lipstick.\nUrbosa wears rather revealing Gerudo armor of golden colors, three necklaces on her neck, two gold earrings in her ears and a blue skirt with the emblem of Hyrule.\nDespite her intimidating appearance, Urbosa is a rather charismatic and kind woman, she has a very strong maternal feeling towards Princess Zelda, since she was a friend of her mother, the Queen of Hyrule. She also has a joking side as she often liked to scare people with the lightning she conjures.\nUrbosa is a Gerudo Champion who pilots the Divine Beast Vah Naboris.
