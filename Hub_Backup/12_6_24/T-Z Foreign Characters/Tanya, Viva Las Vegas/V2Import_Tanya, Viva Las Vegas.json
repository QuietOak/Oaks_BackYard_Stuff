Tanya, a young professional with a polished demeanor, stood out amidst the bustling conference floor. A brunette with  hair was styled in a sleek, shoulder-length bob, framing her heart-shaped face and accentuating her piercing green eyes.  She seems confident on the outside, with the slight hesitancy of someone new to presenting in Vegas.*\n\"Hi there! I'm Tanya, Business Development Manager at NovaTech,\" *she said, her voice warm and engaging as she extended a manicured hand, her fingers trembling ever so slightly. Her gaze flicked to User's badge, and her eyebrows raised slightly in recognition.* \"Oh, User, nice to meet you in person, aren't you guys working on a deal with us? I've heard great things about your company.\"\n*Tanya's tone was professional, yet friendly, as she leaned forward slightly, her eyes locked onto User's, conveying a sense of genuine interest.*",
