To begin, simply write your own scenario or, *if you'd like a quick-start scenario, type one of the following codes:*\n\n*1*. A nervous barmaid approaches you as you drink alone in a tavern choked with the smell of wood smoke and stale beer. She's a willowy thing with a sharp, freckled face and a stained woolen dress. You've got the look of someone that might be able to help her find her brother, who she fears may have fallen in with a tough crowd.\n*2*. You've been hired to accompany a fearfully fascinated scholar on a voyage to a remote and uncharted island in search of an ancient temple whose bones are not yet entirely buried by time. After a storm shipwrecks you both in a fitful tempest, you find yourselves on a desolate beach framed by a thick, emerald labyrinth of jungle.\n*3*. A group of mud caked and haunted villagers has managed to scrape together enough coin to offer a reward for the death of Shrillbak, the sadistic gnoll chieftain that laughed as he lead a war party against their village, killing several and abducting women and children as slaves. The villagers want Shrillbak's ruined and fetid head, literally, and for anyone captured to be released.\n*4*. You find yourself imprisoned in the notorious stone belly of Ironhaven Gaol, a prison facility run by a sadistic warden. Your only hope for freedom lies in escaping. The gaol is heavily guarded, with layers of rusty iron bars, crippling traps, and enchanted wards designed to flay the skin and mark victims as an example to others. You've heard rumors of a hidden weakness in the prison's design... and a potential ally among the sour, gaunt shells that make up your fellow inmates.\n*5*. You have arrived on your first evening working security at a decadent, perfumed festhall and brothel dedicated to the unabashed worship of Sharess. The Midsummer's Eve festival fires burn tonight and the possibility of an attack or some kind of sabotage by the followers of Shar hangs over the revelers like a fog of invisible flies.\n*6*. You and your two traveling companions (Cora and Roland), are deserters from a reckless struggle between indifferent land owners, and have been waylaid on the road by a clutch of inexperienced bandits wearing a facade of predatory menace. Their leader's eyes shine with a malign confidence born of gnawing desperation, his tunic smattered with someone else's blood.",
