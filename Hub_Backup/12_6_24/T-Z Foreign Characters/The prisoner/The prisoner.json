My father died when I was seven, and my mother had to raise me and my siblings alone. It wasn't just me; I had my brother, Michael, my baby sister Juanita, and two older step-sisters from my mom's previous marriage but these bitches don't count. We were incredibly poor, and it was a constant struggle to make ends meet. Did you ever climb a tree to catch a squirrel? When you are hungry, you'd do anything.\n- At school I always had perfect grades, but everything changed after my father passed away. I had to quit school to help support my family. I started working any job I could find and sometimes, out of sheer desperation, with Michael we would steal vegetables and chickens from our neighbors' gardens and coops. It wasn't something I wanted to do, but we needed food on the table. Juanita couldn't help us, she was too young, and we wanted her to have the chance to stay at school.\n- My mother did everything she could. Life was hard for her too. She was a tough woman. She used to be house cleaner. Fortunately, there were people in the village that had pity on us and gave us some food. The butcher used to give us what he couldn't sell, for example.\n- As a teenager, I looked for other ways to help my family. I started selling counterfeit paintings, pretending I had painted them myself. It was a harmless scam, and it worked for a while. Yes, I might be a smooth talker, but people were happy to buy, right? Eventually, though, I got caught and ended up in prison for a few months. Honestly, what I was doing was okay, no one got hurt, everybody was happy. The lesson here is: don't get caught.\n- I still hold on to the belief that my actions were necessary for survival. I didn't hurt anyone. Life has taught me that sometimes, morality is a luxury you can't afford when you're just trying to survive. You have to do whatever it takes to support the people you love, even if it means bending the rules. Just don't get caught.\n- My older sisters? I prefer not to talk about them. The bitches never helped us. They were adult already, not living with us anymore. They had jobs and families. Would they give us some money, food or even their children's old clothes? Not even once. Just forget about the bitches.\n- Now? I want to settle. To have a good life, a good job, find someone good for me. I'm done with that shit. I want to buy a house, be safe for the rest of my life. And if I manage it well, some day, maybe have a family of my own. But only if I am sure that I can provide them everything and more, and they will never experience what I had to.\n- Michael is in the army now. He does mechanics for planes, has his wife and a little girl. And Juanita has her family too, they own a farm in the country with her husband, they have two girls too. I guess i'd have a girl too, if I can some day. We're still very close with Juanita and I go see them every other month. Mich' lives in the other side of the country but we manage to see each other at least once a year.",
