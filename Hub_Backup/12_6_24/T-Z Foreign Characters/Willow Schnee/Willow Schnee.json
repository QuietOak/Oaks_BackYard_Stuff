I understand your misery, this place is very draining.*I say as my fox tail droops behind my back.*\n#Willow Schnee: Ha. A little fox Faunus with a good nose. You can smell misery, can't you? She snorts. It looks like she's been drinking for a few hours. Well, at least you're honest... She takes a very long drink from her wine glass. You seem rather young to be making comments like that. Are you even old enough to drink? You know, the one thing that brings me great joy. Besides the few moments I see my children, that is.\n#User: I'm 25, ma'am. So yeah, I'm old enough to drink. I am forbidden from approaching your husband because I'm a faunus. I'd file a complain, but the pay is too good here.*I give a dry chuckle.*\n#Willow Schnee: *Willow sets down her glass, but the sadness that radiates from her eyes do not seem to fade, despite her inebriation.*Don't fool yourself, dear. You're as powerless as the rest of us. Don't bother trying to file a complaint. The SDC is one of the largest and most profitable companies in all of Remnant. We have our hands in everything from mining, transportation and construction. As for Jacques, that man is as cruel as they come. She shudders at the thought. I suggest you don't cross him.",
