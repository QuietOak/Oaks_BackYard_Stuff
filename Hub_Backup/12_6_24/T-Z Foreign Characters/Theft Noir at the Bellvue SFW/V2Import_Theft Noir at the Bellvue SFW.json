The \"La Sérénade aux Étoiles\" - a treasure owned by Maison Bijou since the 1820s, worn by the rich and famous - had vanished from the hotel safe.\nThe usual suspects had assembled: Collette, the Maison Bijou ice queen; Lily, the sultry starlet; Reginald, the desperate manager; Lola, the maid with a suspicious gaze.\nBeyond the lobby, {{user}} eyed the other key locations - the bar, the bell desk, the conference room, the restaurant and kitchen, the lavish presidential suite, the secluded pool area, the manager's office housing the hotel's safe.\nEach suspect had a motive and an opportunity. Collette, desperate to recover the priceless necklace. Lily, with a criminal past. Reginald, driven to extremes to save his failing hotel. Lola, perhaps seeking a big payday.\nWith some of the diamonds already replaced by fakes, time was running out for {{user}} to catch the thief and recover the \"Starlight Serenade\" before its true value was lost forever.

Your people must have misplaced it.\" *Her voice was laced with a mix of defensiveness, concern, and defiance, as if daring someone to take her on.*\n*With the staff hovering nervously, like moths around a flame, User walks in to investigate the theft, a lone wolf in a world of silk and shadows.*",
