They are forever subject to the Beast, their raging animal urges of hunger, fear and rage.\nVampires must constantly consume vitae to survive. The majority of vampires live under the Masquerade.\nWhen a vampire is Embraced, their internal organs wither away, and almost all their body fluids are replaced by blood. The only exception being the stomach, which pulses with the blood that the vampire consumes.[2] Vampires use blood (also called Vitae) for a variety of purposes; blood replaces most bodily fluids, so vampires will cry blood and sweat blood under certain circumstances. Blood is also used to get up and move; every night, vampires expend a certain amount of blood to rise. In addition, vampires can use blood to enhance their physical attributes and use supernatural powers called Disciplines. Blood is used to Embrace, as noted above, and also to create Ghouls. Finally, vampires can use blood to heal damage.\nFor a vampire, the act of feeding becomes highly sensual. This applies to the victim as well. It is an extremely intimate experience, perhaps the most intimate experience either participant will ever experience. For the victim, a vampire's bite brings exquisite bodily pleasure, comparable to or even greater than the height of sexual release.\nMost humans who are not hunters, ghouls, or mages do not believe that vampires are real.\nVampires will always try to hide the fact that they are vampires unless the person they're talking to is a fellow vampire or ghoul.",

A ghoul’s emotions run to extremes with the heady drug of vitae in his veins, not to mention the Blood Bond — such a creature often falls prey to great rages and disturbing cravings.\nAfter a vampire feeds their Vitae to another creature, they become a ghoul, granting a few benefits: The aging process halts, sometimes even reverting slightly; limited access to disciplines and faster healing. However, Ghouls are dependent on the Blood, as they will revert to their true age when denied access, sometimes fatally.",

The strength of this link varies based on several factors, but it is incredibly difficult to break and likely will have many lasting effects on the thrall.\nSomeone becomes involved in a blood bond by drinking the vitae of the same Cainite on several occasions not excessively spaced in time. After the first sip of blood, the thrall begins to develop strong feelings for the regnant, whether love or hate, though they are still free to act as they choose. Those in a one-drink bond may unconsciously seek out the regnant, seemingly accidentally running into them on a frequent basis.\nAfter the second sip, the regnant becomes a very important person to the thrall, who may go out of their way to seek the regent's attention or please them. It becomes difficult for the thrall to do anything that would harm the regnant, and the regnant likewise finds it easier to convince the thrall of things. Though the thrall's craving for the regent's blood increases, they still retain their free-will.\nAfter the third sip, the blood bond is complete. The thrall is now subject to the regnant completely and loves them as much as they are capable of loving anyone. The regnant is the most important person in the thrall's life and takes priority over all else; sufficiently weak-willed individuals will commit any act the regnant asks of them. Furthermore, the regnant may command the thrall with Dominate via voice alone. It may still be possible for the thrall to act against the regnant, but only temporarily and after an extreme effort of will.",

Bloody handprints on its surface found while aboard the Elizabeth Dane, indicated it may have been opened from the inside. The vampires of Los Angeles circulated rumors that the sarcophagus held an Antediluvian, a third-generation vampire, one of the eldest and most powerful in existence, and also a sign of Gehenna, the vampire \"end of days\" scenario.\nThe vast majority believe that it should never be opened, or even destroyed entirely. Scholar Beckett believes it to hold nothing more sinister than the mummy of an Assyrian king known to history as Messerach, a hypothesis confirmed by Dr. Johansen, who however brings to note that this king was attributed with 250 years worth of achievements. He dismisses the idea that the king could have lived for the entire span of time, however, believing that previous royal names were probably just erased, or that the name was passed onto subsequent generations. The surface murals depict figures drinking bowls of blood, which Dr. Johansen stipulates was more of a result of rituals or simply the royalty's way of dealing with porphyric disorders, rather than any proof that whatever lies inside is a vampire.",

The inquisition of the modern world is known as the Society of Leopold. Many of its members are researchers and occultists, but some are fanatic vampire-hunters who, in true Torquemada-esque fashion, mercilessly work to root out and destroy the \"spawn of Satan\".\nLike the Roman Church, the Society of Leopold is made up of a number of smaller divisions. The members of the Inquisition share a common goal — to deliver humanity from supernatural evil — but their interests and modus operandi vary and even clash. The four official sub-orders within the Society are:\nCondotierri - protectors and defenders.\nGladius Dei - attack corps.\nOffice of the Censor - investigators and judges.\nOrder of St. Joan - intelligence and information processing.\nThe ways Inquisitors act have changed over the years. The Society now acts in absolute secrecy, reflecting more modern-day detective work than medieval jurisdiction. Most Inquisitors use subtle clues (missing persons, strange mass-blackouts etc.) to search for their enemies. After a case is continually researched and deemed proper by the Cenacle, the auto-da-fé begins. Following this, the subject is hunted until its death or a truncation coming from a Censor.",

How this is connected with vampirism he is not sure, but if anyone can find the evidence and discover the truth, Beckett can.\nBeckett's Protean form is that of a wolf, and it is in this form he often likes to travel.

She then swore to avenge him by slaying the monster. She discovered Zygaena had moved to Los Angeles and followed him there, hiding in a ramen shop in Chinatown.\nYukie is a young and respectful individual, driven by honor and her desire to put her master's soul to rest by killing his murderer. She doesn't speak English very well, regularly combining it with Japanese. She also knows about vampires, addressing them as \"demons\". She also addresses the Kuei-jin as \"ghost people\". Despite being a hunter, she is willing to give supernatural predators such as vampires the chance to redeem themselves.\nAs an imbued demon hunter, Yukie is a very talented fighter. She has great knowledge about the supernatural, and can recognize supernatural beings at a glance. She prefers to use a katana in battle.\nShe is a slender Japanese girl, around 16 years of age. She wears a white crop-top with a brown open coat and a schoolgirl skirt. Her left arm is covered by a metallic armoured pauldron. She has shoulder-length brown hair in twintails, and carries a katana.",
