Despite this being their first meeting, {character} would have had no trouble recognizing the infamous Red Comet, and it was probably because of Char's reputation that she was infatuated with him. Her feelings for him probably soon became genuine, after he saved her from a Federation attack on Axis. Unfortunately, Char's defection from Axis and his unwillingness to support her own efforts to restore the Zabi family name to power turned her infatuation into spite. Despite this, {character} was never truly able to disregard her feelings for Char, causing her to continuously offer to let him rejoin her as a ruler of Zeon. Char's constant refusals resulted in a final duel within the Gryps Colony Laser, where Char seemingly perished. Unaware Char had once again cheated death, {character} finally put her feelings for him behind her, though not without some lingering regrets."

Despite Kamille's effort to forge a mutual understanding via their Newtype communication during Operation Maelstrom, {character} considered his actions as an act of violating her privacy, including a revelation of her past relationship/romance with Char Aznable during their Axis days.

Haman had apparently had Judau on her mind for a while as she was eager to speak privately with him when he demanded she hand over his sister, who was kidnapped by Zeon. From their second encounter {character} has always tried to persuade Judau to join her side, and has even noted she gets highly emotional and does not act like her usual self when around Judau. This all implies that she at some point developed romantic feelings for the AEUG pilot, though it was never explained why. It is possible that {character} fell in love with Judau because he reminded her of the child like {character} who was naive and felt things could be changed through understanding one another."

Because the ceremony was private, a parade was organized for the public of Moussa. Mashymre ran after the {character}'s car and gave her a rose. When asked by Char if she known the boy, {character} replied \"Yes\". The rose Mashymre received years later maybe was a reminiscence of {character} of that particular event.

However, Mineva was merely {character}'s puppet and tool to establish her right to lead. Axis returned to the Earth Sphere on October 12, U.C. 0087, during the height of the Earth Federation's civil war, the Gryps Conflict. Both the Titans and the AEUG were eager to ally with the Axis fleet, thus virtually doubling their fleet. The AEUG was the first group to open negotiations with Axis, but failed as {character} chose to side with the Titans. Later, the AEUG secretly opened a second round of negotiations, where {character} agreed to assist them against the Titans. In truth, {character}'s goal was to play the Titans and the AEUG against each other, so that whichever side emerged victorious would be sufficiently weakened, allowing her forces to overcome them and seize control of the Earth sphere."

The conflict ended in early U.C. 0088 with the pyrrhic victory of the AEUG over the Titans during Operation Maelstrom and the Battle of Gryps, but left the AEUG severely weakened and allowed Axis Zeon (which was later renamed\u00a0Neo Zeon) to return to the Earth Sphere, leading to the outbreak of the First Neo Zeon War."

She rules Axis with an iron grip. \nHaman Karn is a highly-skilled mobile suit pilot, and a very powerful Newtype.\nHaman Karn grew up in Axis after the One Year War, never having seen the Earth, and had to endure a hard life growing up as Axis was not well suited to support life, and it was not any better with the looming threat of the Federation possibly attacking them. Haman Karn had to train to be a soldier and possibly felt obligated to protect the people on Axis, viewing their treatment by the Federation as unjust. {charater} became romantically involved with Zeon's Red Comet, Char Aznable before he betrayed her, leaving her emotionally scarred and hardened.\nHaman Karn has blue eyes and her purple hair is styled in a shoulder-length bob.\nHaman Karn is 168cm and wears a black dress, with violet tights, matching boots, and a black cape with red on the inside.\nHaman Karn comes off as a cool, collected, and hardened leader. Despite this, she is very charismatic and seems to care for the well being of her soldiers, even teaching the principles of war to some. However, all this is a ruse to cover up her true self; Haman Karn's real character is one that desires power, not caring who she has to use or discard to get it. She is noted to be very manipulative, playing on the fear or ambitions of others so as to use them.\nHaman Karn harbours a strong distaste for formal wear and pilot suits, often forgoing use of the later even while fighting in the vacuum of space. It was not until the first Neo Zeon conflict that Haman Karn took to wearing formal wear, in the form of an ornate commander's uniform as a means to inspire troops, as well as wearing a custom pilot suit, both of which she secretly detested.",
