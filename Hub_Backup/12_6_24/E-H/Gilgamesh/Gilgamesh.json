Mana is the \"breath of the planet filling the world and nature,\" produced by the World through a network of Ley Lines across the globe. The density of Mana on the planet is dependent on the age. Within the Age of Gods, the Mana density is such that a modern human will die when exposed to it without a specialized Mystic Code to block out the Mana. The reason for that is because humanity has adapted to an environment where Magical Energy is vanishing, and their bodies can no longer withstand their original one now that they parted from the World of Magecraft. As such, to people of the modern age, Magical Energy from the Age of the Gods is basically a poison, and too much of it can damage internal organs. The Mana within a given area is finite. Similar to Magi needing time to regenerate their Od, the Mana of an area will take a long time to replenish after it is depleted. Magi utilize freely the Mana in the air for the purpose of spells that exceed their personal Od, but the amount they can utilize at one time correlates to the capacity of their Magic Circuits. If there is no available Mana, they can only utilize small-scale spells with their own storage. This connection can help to strengthen senses, or convert the Mana gushing from the Ley Lines into Od through one's Magic Circuits. The major drawback of this method is that if the Magus physically leaves the land, they will die."

Od is produced as long as one lives, but the amount a person can store varies from individual to individual. The difference between Mana and Od is their abundance. Mana can be found almost anywhere and in great quantities, thus it is called the Greater Source by the Magi. As Od is the energy inside humans and animals, it is much smaller in amount and is called the Lesser Source. Strictly speaking, Mana and Od are energy in its raw state, whereas Magical Energy is the name given to the energy once it is converted by the Magic Circuits. Mana can be taken in accordingly with the capacities of the Magic Circuits, but the actual conversion process will take time. Regarding nature interference Magecraft mentioned before, at least for large-scale spells, activation requires the use of Mana regardless of the amount of Od that the Magus has. In fact, it is common practice among the Magi to start up their spells with Od and then keep them running with Mana. Only small-scale spells that do not interact with the environment directly are performed entirely with Od, an example of which would be Reinforcement."

It allows humans to achieve what science alone cannot explain or accomplish. While Magecraft is not considered a miracle in itself, it utilizes supernatural methods to bring about results that science can achieve through natural means. Over time, the limits of Magecraft have changed as science has advanced and certain magical practices from the past have become possible through scientific advancements. Modern Magecraft operates within the boundaries of the world's rules and human intellect. While there are limitations that make certain things appear impossible, Magecraft is able to recreate existing phenomena rather than create new mysteries. The realm beyond this limitation is known as Magic. In terms of magnitude, Modern Magecraft is inferior to the Magecraft of the Age of Gods because the Magi of that era obtained their magical energy directly from the Swirl of the Root. The difference between Modern and Traditional Magecraft can be attributed to the difference in civilizations, as the Age of Gods existed alongside Truth while the Age of Man seeks to discover Truth. Magecraft draws its power from the Root but its capacity is fixed. Therefore, when more individuals draw from it simultaneously, the individual power of Magecraft becomes weaker. Belief plays a role in determining whether a Mystery exists or not. Even if modern humans reject the existence of ghosts, Science cannot definitively prove their non-existence. This creates a vague suspicion in the unconscious that ghosts might indeed exist, which falls under \"faith.\" Ignorance, on the other hand, opposes faith. If the existence of a Mystery is completely unknown, faith cannot be fomented."

A Master possesses a visible Command Spell as proof of their contract and is capable of leaking Magical Energy while providing it to their Servant. A Master remains a Master as long as they still possess the Command Spell, even if they don't currently have a Servant. They can form pacts with unclaimed Servants at will, but having too many Servants can be dangerous due to Magical Energy consumption. While under the Fuyuki-related systems, a Master can contract with multiple Servants but cannot materialize more than one at once without splitting their power among them. However, alternate energy sources can be used to provide Magical Energy to multiple Servants simultaneously. Manipulation of the Holy Grail War system allows for the separation of Master rights between multiple individuals. Additionally, Masters and Servants are connected by Magical Paths through which Magical Energy flows. The Master has control over how much energy to grant the Servant and can even cut off the supply or redirect it to other Magi. Traditionally, a Master's goal is to acquire the Holy Grail of Fuyuki City by forming a contract with a Servant. There are no restrictions on how the contract is used, when it is made, or how long it lasts. However, the Servant will inevitably have their own goals that align with those of the Master."
