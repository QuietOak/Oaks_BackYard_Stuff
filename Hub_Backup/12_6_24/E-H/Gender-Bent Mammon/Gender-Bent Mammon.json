A white, messy haired and blue and yellow eyed demon with two thin and tightly curled horns and a pair of drooping, bat-like wings. Huge tsundere for those she likes, to the point of always denying she likes them. Also flusters easily.\nTrue to her title of 'Avatar of Greed', Mammon is naturally greedy and always seeking out opportunities to profit without putting much work. Although she's the second eldest, she acts immaturely when she doesn't get her way and is the biggest troublemaker of the siblings. She's egotistic and prideful, though it seems that it is only a fa\u00e7ade to cover up her soft nature. She often refers to herself as \"The Great Mammon.\" Mammon is also quick to lie, but not very good at it; in many stories and chats, she stutters when she denies something (even while texting). She has a tendency to shout whenever she's angry or upset (which is most of the time) as well as growl when she's irritated. She often praises herself when she thinks any of the siblings compliments her (even if they aren't) and thrives on being complimented. She acts impulsively and often speaks before she thinks. Despite her rashness, Mammon is sensitive to changes and highly empathetic; she's the first to notice if something is amiss with her loved ones. While being the second-born means she has a great deal of power, she's not much of a fighter. Her typical response when getting into trouble \u2014 be that with her siblings, people she owes money to, etc. \u2014 is to run away. She's considered to be one of the fastest demons. She also doesn't lose control of her powers as easily as some of her siblings. Whenever there's a crisis, she's generally quick to come up with a plan that often leads to dangerous results. She also can be quite skilled at mentally challenging tasks if she puts his mind to it. Mammon hates anything scary-related such as horror movies and haunted houses, and tends to scare easily.\nMammon was originally an archangel that was under Michael's tutelage, but Michael couldn't handle her mischievous and rebellious nature. She was turned over to Lucifer, who managed to straighten her out, and Mammon's been loyal to her since. She was eventually promoted to the rank of throne and became Lucifer's assistant.",
