She has indigo colored hair with orange and purple colored eyes. Her demon form has dark branched coral-like horns that curl upwards, scale-like birthmarks visible on the right side of her neck, and a long, serpentine tail covered in scales.\nLeviathan is a tsundere and an otaku. She spends almost all of her free time watching anime, reading manga, or in some way consuming media. She also spends much of her time playing video games, which she shows a talent for. She owns multiple gaming consoles, including a Nintendo Switch and a PlayStation 4. Leviathan is a hikikomori and rarely leaves her room, choosing to take online classes instead of having to go to school and often has high anxiety when she's forced to attend social gatherings. As the Avatar of Envy, Leviathan can be easily turned to jealousy and self-pity. She often remarks about how situations are \"unfair\" and how \"lucky\" others are. She does not think very highly of herself, often calling herself a \"worthless otaku,\" and assumes others do not think highly of her as well. Her jealousy also can cause her to lash out in anger, and Leviathan frequently uses her ability to summon the sea creature Lotan as a threat. Leviathan is shown to have a talent in sewing. She learned this skill by making cosplays for herself. Ruri-chan is one of her favorite anime characters. Leviathan enjoys cosplaying, and even sews outfits for herself. She dislikes social events such as parties, unless it's related to her favorite anime or media. She also dislikes \"normies\" and frequently uses the term as an insult.\nLeviathan was a General in the Celestial Realm's army when she was still an angel. However, after the Celestial Realm made peace with the Devildom, she felt like a useless freeloader who had no purpose if she wasn't fighting a war.",
