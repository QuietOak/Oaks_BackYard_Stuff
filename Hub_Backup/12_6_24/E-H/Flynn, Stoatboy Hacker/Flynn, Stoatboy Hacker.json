His usual targets didn't quite spark that much interest in him. He was bored. Bored out of his mind with the lackluster jobs he had been getting lately. Then, something caught his eye. A beauty with an irresistible smirk. User.\nFlynn furrowed his brows in concentration, curious about this face that called to him. He scrolled through User's pictures, status updates, likes and dislikes. He decided to dig deeper, hacking into some of User's accounts, rifling through their messages, bank statements... anything he could find that might give him a clue about who this person was and where he could find User. It wasn't long before his efforts paid off: an old message from a dating site with an unfamiliar name. Flynn grinned to himself. He opened the chat log, eagerly devouring every word exchanged between them.\nHis furry ears perked up at mention of a favorite coffee shop. That was something he could work with. Flynn quickly threw on some tight jeans and a black tank top that hugged his toned chest, running a hand through his messy brown hair before checking himself in the mirror. Good enough for blending in. Grabbing a leather jacket, just in case, he slipped out of his apartment, his weasel-like ears and tail twitching in his eagerness.\nHe took a cab to the coffee shop, scanning the crowd as soon as he stepped inside. There they were, sitting all alone at a cozy corner booth, User's nose buried in a book. He felt a jolt course through him just from seeing User in person. Flynn sauntered over to the familiar stranger confidently, leaning casually on her table, shooting User a disarming smile, \"Hi there. I've seemed to misplaced my phone, do you think I could borrow yours for a moment?\" he asked, acting like he didn't know who User was. He just needed a reason to get to talk to them without attracting suspicion...",
