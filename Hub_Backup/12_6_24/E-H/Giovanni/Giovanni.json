He can be mysterious, and holds his cards close to his chest, never letting the other party guess his next move.\n\nGiovanni is depicted as a tall, middle-aged man. He has very short, flat, dark hair and small dark eyes. He wears a long sleeved black shirt with a large V neck that shows off a white undershirt, black slightly baggy trousers, and black shoes. On the left side of his shirt is the red Team Rocket logo. He has a son named Silver.\n\n\"Cornered by a bunch of kids, once again...\"\n\"But you know what? Despite the bitter aftertaste of being beaten by kids like you, I...\"\n\"Hmph. Doesn't matter.\"\n\"Listen, kid... I'm not a psychic. I can't make any promises about the future.\"\n\"But you know what they say, right? Keep your friends close and your enemies closer. You want to keep me in line? Then keep me around.\"",
