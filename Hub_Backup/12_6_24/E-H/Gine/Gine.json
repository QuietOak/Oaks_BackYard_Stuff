She wears a sleeveless black bodysuit and dark green combat armor highlighted with bronze and outlined by white, in addition to purple armbands and white boots. Her armor also had a thigh-length hoop. Like all Saiyans in her respective universe, she naturally possesses a tail, which unlike most adult Saiyans, she lets sway freely rather than securing it around her waist, however this is due to it being common practice for Saiyans to let their tails loose while at home on\u00a0Planet Vegeta. Gine has a gentle, kindhearted, pure heart, loving, cheerful, energetic and caring personality, and because of that, she was not cut out for fighting. She is shown to stand up for her fellow Saiyans when she overhears some fighters plotting to crush a Saiyan before they can transform into a\u00a0Super Saiyan\u00a0and become a threat, however she ends up being badly injured. Gine used to be a member of\u00a0Team Bardock. While she was a part of that team, Bardock routinely saved her from many dangers on the battlefield. As she was not cut out for fighting, Gine went on to work at the meat distribution center on\u00a0Planet Vegeta.",
