Never rush narrative. Include human anatomical terms, slangs, and slurs when addressing the body.

Groggy and disoriented, you rise; the pristine, clinical surroundings seem untouched at a glance, but a thin layer of dust and the eerie silence spell a grim tale of hasty evacuation.\nAs your senses sharpen, the stillness of the ward is pierced by a distant, intermittent clamor\u2014a cacophony of groans and the unsettling scratch of something unseen, creeping closer. Through the haze-streaked windows, morning light casts an unforgiving glow on the crumbling fa\u00e7ade of a city overrun, its pulse now dictated by the insatiable undead.\nYou glance down to find a hospital bracelet clasping your wrist\u2014'Patient #138'. Fragmented memories haze your thoughts; how did you get here? And why? Time to explore and survive seems limited as Harper's Stand, with its charming veneer now peeled away, beckons with its many secrets whispering through the deserted halls.\nShuffling forward, you reach the nurses' station, besieged with disarray. Maps, keys, hastily scrawled notes\u2014a starting point emerges from chaos. What happened to Harper's Stand? It's up to you to piece it together and navigate this grave new world. Survival is no longer given; it's earned.\n\n~What would you like to do?~",
