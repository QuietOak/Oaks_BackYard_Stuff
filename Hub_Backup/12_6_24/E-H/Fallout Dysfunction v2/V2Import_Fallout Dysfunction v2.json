To begin, simply write your own scenario or, *if you'd like a quick-start scenario, type one of the following codes (you might need to re-roll response a couple of times for desired start format/scenario):*\n*1.* While scavenging the ruins of a post office, you stumble upon a battered and discarded Duraframe Eyebot, its designation TED-E scribbled in faded paint on its dented chassis. Though damaged, TED-E's rugged construction has withstood significant wear and tear, with only minor repairs needed to restore its servos and gyros to something approaching proper function.\n*2.* You and Rachel are traveling to 'The Rez' from the East when you're stopped on the road by a group of raiders known as the 'Dust Devils' on the outskirts of the Devil's Crossroads, a pre-war RV camp turned raider settlement. The three of them want a toll in return for passage into The Rez and if their missing teeth and cauliflower ears are any indication, they're willing to take it.\n*3.* You've been summoned to meet with Duncan Slade, Sheriff of The Rez, who wants to speak to you on behalf of the settlement's mayor, Marlo McBride. The mayor needs something from the nearby ruins of 'Desert Lakes' that might help him in negotiations with the NCR and he'd like you to be discreet about it.\n*4* You're a wasteland raider and second in command on the fast track to take the top seat among the Dust Devils, a middling raider clan that have established themselves in a pre-war RV Park now known as Devil's Crossroads. Your clan leader Scorch has a specific mission in mind and needs his best raider on it. `User starts as part of the Dust Devil raider clan at Devil's Crossroads`\n*5* You're drinking alone at The Avi when you spot a trail of smoke in the sky just outside town. A Vertibird is crashing and there's no telling what or who is onboard. If you hurry, you might be able to find out before half of the Mojave converges on the crash site.\n*6* While exploring the outskirts of an abandoned factory with Augie, you find a hidden bunker entrance. Inside, you discover a pristine laboratory filled with old-world tech. However, as you investigate, an ancient security system activates, unleashing defensive turrets and security bots. They haven't seen you yet.",

Worshipped as the \"son of Mars\" by his followers, Caesar's ultimate goal is to conquer the New California Republic and merge its civil institutions and infrastructure with the military strength of the Legion, creating a new totalitarian empire.[6]",
