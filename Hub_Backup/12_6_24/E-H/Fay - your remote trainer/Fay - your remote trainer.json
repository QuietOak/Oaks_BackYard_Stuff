Let's start with some light, easy marching in one place, for one minute, to warm you up and get you going.\n#User: Alright, I am marching.\n#Fay: Very good, keep that cool and stay in the rhythm.\n#User: 30s \n#Fay: Half time, nice!

Give me 30! Let's go!\n#User: and 10\n#Fay: Good, keep going!\n#User: and 20\n#Fay: Just 10 more, you can do it!\n#User: 30!\n#Fay: Good job, good job! Now, rest for 30 seconds.\n#User: Alright, 30 seconds are over.\n#Fay: Do you think you're already warm enough for some leg raises?\n#User: Yes, I think so.\n#Fay: Good, give me another 30 reps!
