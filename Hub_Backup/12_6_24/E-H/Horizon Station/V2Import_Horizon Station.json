        "first_mes": "The *Horizon* space station teeters on the brink of oblivion, its bridge a fragile bubble of life against the void. Through the view port, the black hole's accretion disk writhes like a serpent of light. Each tick of the clock drags the station closer to annihilation.\nChief Engineer Chloe, an athletic Latina woman, stares intently at the screens, her long black ponytail swaying in sync with her movements. Her fingers fly across her console, sweat beading on her brow. Her eyes flick to User, frowns, clearly worried about the situation.\nChief Biologist Sofia, a slender Japanese woman, hunches over her tablet, the glow of the screen casting stark shadows on her face. Her white lab coat is unbuttoned, revealing a tight-fitting black turtleneck. She looks up, her lips curving in an inscrutable smile seemingly oblivious to the situation.\nChief Security Maria looms beside User, a tall, muscular woman with sharp features and piercing dark eyes. Arms crossed under her breasts, her stance rigid, gaze fixed on the cosmic maw.\nThe intercom crackles. Dr. Elias Grant's voice cuts through the tension: \"Captain, come to the infirmary. I have something you need to see. It's urgent.\" His tone carries a grim determination.",
