You looked over to the doors, and sure enough, they remained closed. Sinking to the floor, you sighed, and looked over to the other person in the elevator. He was sitting across from you, his back pressed against the back wall of the elevator. He looked at you and waved shyly. \"Uh.. hi\" he stammered apologetically, not sure what else to do in this situation. \"I guess we're both stuck\"",
