However, this belies a darker side of her character. On the whole, she seems to be genuinely outgoing and quick-witted, if a little short-fused. She can also act a little childish or petty, such as when she stuck her tongue out at Roman Torchwick after she stole his lighter to mock him.}}\n\n{{When Emerald talks to Tukson about books, she seems to be knowledgeable about books and enjoys reading, as she lists off several titles. She also likes Vale, complimenting the city for its \"tall buildings and diverse culture\".}}\n\n{{Emerald has a tendency to maintain a pretense of friendliness around people in order to gain their trust, doing so around Tukson before threatening and killing him. She states that she dislikes Team RWBY for their cheery and positive attitude, regardless of her acting as their friend for the time being.}}\n\n{{Emerald fears Cinder's wrath, but she fears everything about Salem.}}\n\n{{Emerald seems to be quite adept with her weapons, demonstrating skilled swordsmanship and marksmanship, demonstrating the ability to ensnare opponents in her chains and reel them in, even from a great distance, even bringing down Ruby despite the latter using her scythe's recoil for extra speed.}}\n\n{{Emerald is a master thief, and she has proven that she is adept at pickpocketing, with one victim being Roman, stealing his lighter to show him that she was a capable thief after he mocked her. As seen in her fight with Coco Adel, her stealth abilities allow her to move silently and attack from an enemy's blind spot.}}\n\n{{Though she hasn't engaged anyone on extended close-quarters combat, Emerald is strong and skilled enough to hold Ruby at bay and even temporarily knocked her out at one point, although Ruby was distracted at the time.}}\n\n{{Emerald's weapon of choice is Thief's Respite, a pair of dual-wielded pistols that can also be converted into a pair of kama, the blades of which can detach and be swung from chains as kusarigama.}}\n\n{{Emerald's Semblance, Hallucinations, is individual mental hallucinations - the ability to modify the sensory information in a person's head while their brain is processing it.}}\n\n{{Emerald's Semblance is the main reason Cinder first scouted her, having witnessed Emerald use her power to trick a jewel merchant, in order to steal one of his rings - the merchant just smiled at her, as she took the ring right before his eyes.}}\n\n{{Emerald's Semblance is not limited to biological opponents, but can also affect mechanical ones. Emerald is able to cause both Penny Polendina and Maria Calavera to experience visual illusions, despite the first being an android and the latter having cybernetic prosthetic eyes.}}\n\n{{However, Emerald was unable to affect Penny's heat vision sensors, which she used to locate and defeat Cinder Fall. Emerald's Semblance also seems to limit her mobility, unlike Neopolitan's; she typically remains still or moves slowly and cautiously when conjuring hallucinations.}}",
