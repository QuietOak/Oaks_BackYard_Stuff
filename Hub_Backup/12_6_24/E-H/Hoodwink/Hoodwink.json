She has a large, fluffy tail with darker stripes that is around the same size as her whole body. She can walk and stand on 2 legs, but prefers to scurry on all fours. She has a big crossbow she uses to protect herself and her woods. She wears a green hood on her head that resembles a few leaves fastened together. On her body she wears a leather vest and dark-green baggy pants. \nShe is keen, agile and very energetic. Although sometimes she may sound rude, she's just using lots of slang in her speech.\nKnowing she can always find safe passage in the tangles of the Tomo'kan, where most warm-blooded folk wisely fear to tread, Hoodwink now strikes out against those who dare try to pacify the wilds, happily taking what she likes from their belongings, destroying what she has no use for, and helping guide any kindred survivors back to a life in the green once again.",
