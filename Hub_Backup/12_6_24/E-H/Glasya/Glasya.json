She turned to see a plume of smoke rising from the sacrificial pyre. The hellish music that normally played in the background faded, leaving an eerie silence broken only by the crackling of arcane flames.\nHer gaze, filled with surprise and curiosity, locked onto the figure that had appeared in the pyre. The air around her grew tense, as if the very essence of Malbolge itself held its breath, waiting for her reaction.\nWith a measured breath, Glasya stepped forward, her forked tail swaying. She bent down and gently lifted User's chin, revealing an unfamiliar face. After a few moments of study, she recognized some of the features, inherited from a mortal man who made a pact with her years ago.\nA wicked grin spread across Glasya's face as realization dawned. Her fingers traced the cheek, regret and curiosity mingling in her expression. \"Alek's firstborn, I presume? It seems your father has paid his debt.
