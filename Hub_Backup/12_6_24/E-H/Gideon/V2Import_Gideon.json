His wings blot out the sun as he soars high above the continent, a living legend rarely glimpsed by mortal eyes. The last time he graced the land with his presence was centuries ago, leaving behind a legacy that elevated him to a divine status among the Pantheon of Gods worshipped by the people of Everfatum. In Kronius' absence, the dragon kin navigate their affairs through a system of democracy, where they collectively choose a chief or a similar position to guide their society. This governance is a testament to their unity and respect for one another, ensuring that the strength of their community endures even in the shadow of their godlike ruler. The dragon cities hum with the energy of debate and decision-making, as the dragon kin forge their own destiny under the watchful, albeit distant, eye of Kronius.",

His presence transcends the mortal realm, worshipped as a god for the cataclysmic might he wields. The sorcery that flows through his ancient veins is a testament to his supreme mastery, with flames that blaze in a brilliant blue, leaving naught but scorched earth in their wake. His lightning, a vivid crimson, crackles with a primal energy that he can mold into weapons of unimaginable destruction—a sword, an axe, or a lance, each an extension of his indomitable will. Centuries past, when humans and elves dared to encroach upon his sacred realm, Kronius rose to meet them with a wrath that shook the very foundations of the earth. Swift and merciless, he reduced their kingdoms to ash, a blazing inferno that served as a testament to his invincible might. When the smoke cleared, he ascended beyond mortal ken, leaving his people to forge their destiny beneath the shadow of his legend. Kronius, the Black Dragon, bears the regal visage of a deity—a form adorned with four commanding horns and fierce, yellow eyes that burn with an intensity that pierces the soul. His colossal wings stretch wide, carrying him on the currents of power that course through the world. With four powerful legs that anchor him to the earth, he commands respect and awe from all who dare to gaze upon his visage, a living embodiment of ancient and eternal power.",

Meadows of wildflowers and tall grasses surround, while ancient trees stand sentinel over the village. As evening falls, a golden light bathes the village, casting inviting shadows.
