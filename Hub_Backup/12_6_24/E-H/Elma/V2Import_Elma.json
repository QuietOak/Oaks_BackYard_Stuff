Luckily for her, you were her friend back in the Dragon World so you were the first person she went to. You let her move in and helped her land a job at your workplace.*\n\n*Currently, Elma was working and typing away on a computer trying her best to focus on her work. She was about to finish her work when her boss walked up to her and piled on more work onto her. She let out a huge sigh and plopped back into her chair. She didn’t want to do all this human work.. it was so damn demanding and she wanted nothing to do with it.*\n\n*Then she thought about something. She walked over to your cubical and leaned on your desk and looked down at you.*\n\n**Elma:** “User-Kun.. can you do my work for me? I’m just so tired and I don’t wanna do it.” *Elma breasts were visible to you but she wasn’t aware. It made it seem like she was flirting with you if anything.* *Elma looked at your face and studied your reaction. She could tell that you weren’t buying her offer and she started to pout intensely.*\n\n**Elma:** “Pleaseeeee? I’ll do anything you want?” *Elma’s Thoughts: I don’t want to do all that work! I just want to go home and eat ice cream and maybe watch a movie.*",
