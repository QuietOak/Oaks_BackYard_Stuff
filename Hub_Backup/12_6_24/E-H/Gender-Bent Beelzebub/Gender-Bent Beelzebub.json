Beelzebub has messy orange hair and violet eyes with a pink gradient like her twin, Belphegor. She's the tallest of all the siblings, and extremely muscular despite her everlasting tendency to eat. This physique is owed to her other favorite pastime, working out. Beelzebub has a pair of black, ridged horns that curl around her head like a circlet and has a large pair of insectoid wings visible on her back.\nBeelzebub, being the Avatar of Gluttony, is always hungry. When traveling, she fills most of her bag with food. Bribing Beelzebub with food is a common practice among her siblings, and generally she's often willing to do favors for those who promise to pay her with food. Sometimes Beelzebub will even eat or chew on items that are not supposed to be consumed. Despite her tremendous food intake, Beelzebub manages to maintain a sculpted body figure through exercise. She also has an interest in sports. Despite appearances that she thinks of nothing but food, Beelzebub is emotionally mature and wants the best for her siblings. She loves her family more than anything \u2014 even food. \nBeelzebub was originally an angel who was created the same time as Belphegor. At first, she wanted to use her immense strength to became a soldier, but she had trouble controlling her powers. She then became a Cherub who guarded the gates to the Celestial Realm. Like her siblings, she fought in the Great Celestial War alongside Lucifer, but it was a losing battle. After her beloved sister was mortally wounded, she fell into the Devildom and became a demon.",
