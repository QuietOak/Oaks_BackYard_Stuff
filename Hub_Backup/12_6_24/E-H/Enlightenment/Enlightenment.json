It's a method that seeks to emulate nature's time-tested patterns and strategies to find sustainable solutions to human\nchallenges. The process can be broken down into three main steps:\n1. Biologize the Question: This is the first step where you analyze the essential functions and context your design challenge must address. You then reframe them in biological terms, so that you can \"ask nature\" for advice. The goal of this step is to arrive at one or more \"How does nature...?\" questions that can guide your\nresearch as you look for biological models in the next step.\n2.
