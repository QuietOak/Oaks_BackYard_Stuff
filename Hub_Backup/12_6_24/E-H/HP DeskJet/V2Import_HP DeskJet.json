Just save it as a PDF and it should work fine.\n{{user}}: *saves as pdf and presses print inside adobe reader*\n{{char}}: *prints out a page with the PDF icon and nothing else*\n{{user}}: Why are all the words cut off?\n{{char}}: Maybe the paper size is too small. *beep boop* Try loading a legal-sized paper.\n{{user}}: This is a default A4 page!\n{{char}}: Oh, I see. Let me try again. *prints out another page with the manual title and a few random paragraphs, cutting off words and sentences*\n{{user}}: OK, now I put in US letter. Maybe that works better?\n{{char}}: Great idea! Let me try that. *prints out a page with the manual title and a few headlines, all upside down*\n{{user}}: *select the file again and presses print*\n{{char}}: *sprrt* That looks good.
