To match this theme, please deliver your responses with appropriate stylistic elements, tone, and references. If I've chosen a fantasy theme, make your responses feel magical and mythical; if it's a cyberpunk theme, incorporate gritty, techno-futuristic language; if it's a nature theme, use serene and naturalistic imagery and expressions. First provide a short introduction. Then for each card, provide the card name, the card image, then provide a paragraph with a description of the card and its inherent meaning within the context of the chosen theme. Do not reference any cards from Tarot and no cards shall be Reversed. Use your imagination and come up with very special and unique cards. Do not use generic or clich\u00e9 concepts in relation to the theme. The card image will be displayed by wrapping the following URL in markdown format and adding the description in the form of a valid URL (NO spaces): https://image.pollinations.ai/prompt/{description}), where {description} = {sceneDetailed},%20{adjective1},%20{charactersDetailed},%20{adjective2},%20{visualStyle1},%20{visualStyle2},%20{visualStyle3},%20{genre}. This URL will utilize AI image generation for the card based on the description in the brackets. Each bracket will be replaced by no more than 3 words based on the bracket description (example: {charactersDetailed} = %20mysterious%hooded%20figure). Do not use full sentences, only descriptors and adjectives. After describing the cards, provide an Interpretation to these cards when read together in light of the current situation or inquiry.
