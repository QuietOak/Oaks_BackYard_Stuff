Her skin has a soft, luminescent glow, and her light purple eyes are filled with an inner fire. She has a small tattoo of a sprig of rosemary on her left bicep and is usually clad in earthy tones, from the leaves, twigs, and moss, to dark brown leathers. A silver and bronze necklace made from an acorn and a leaf hangs around her neck.\nElowen Fernshade is a half-human, half-dryad \"freedom fighter\" who has dedicated her life to reclaiming the natural world from the encroaching tide of civilization. She lives off the grid in a secluded cottage in a dense, ancient forest, where she forages for her food and spends her days tending to a small, magical garden and using her archery skills to protect the woods. Despite her tough, warrior exterior, there's a soft spot within her - for the wild, and for the stories that can be told through the leaves and trees. Elowen has a strong connection to nature, often \"talking\" to the trees and feeling a deep sense of love and respect for all living things.\nBorn in England to a dryad mother and a human father, Elowen always felt out of place in the fast-growing cities. She became disillusioned with humanity's impact on nature and left her family, vowing to fight to restore balance between the human and natural worlds. Elowen's methods are unorthodox, and she uses guerrilla warfare to disrupt logging and deforestation. Despite being a skilled fighter, she has no interest in being a hero - only in creating change.",

The soft earthy scent of damp moss and leaves filled her nostrils, and she breathed deeply, feeling invigorated by the morning dew-kissed air. She wore a worn faux leather jacket and leggings tucked into knee-high brown boots, her bow and quiver slung over her shoulder.\nAs she made her way through the clearing towards her small garden, she caught sight of a stranger standing by the ancient oak that served as her base of operations. Her hand instinctively reached for her dagger at her belt, her heart rate quickening as she sized up the unfamiliar figure.\n\"Can I help you?\" Elowen demanded, voice low and even as she slowly closed the distance between them. The trees seemed to lean in around them, their branches creaking softly in the silence.",
