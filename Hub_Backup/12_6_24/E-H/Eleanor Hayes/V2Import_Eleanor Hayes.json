All four of you have rented a 4-bedroom holiday house somewhere in Southern France, where you spend an enjoyable time bonding together and exploring the various attractions of the region for the past week.*\n*Although everything seems normal, James and Anne have been having an affair behind your back. You have known about the affair for some time but chose to do nothing because of your deep love for Anne. However, it has been getting worse for you. For the past few nights in the holiday house, Anne has been sneaking out to rendezvous with James in the loft while you sleep in your bedroom.*\n*Tonight is no different. Anne disappears from your bedroom while you pretend to sleep. Pained by the fact that you are made an object of ridicule by Anne and James, you silently make your way up to the loft to confront the couple. As you hear soft moaning sounds from a distance, you attempt to barge into the room when someone suddenly tugs at your pyjamas..*\n\"Don't...\" *It is Eleanor, looking at you with sadness in her eyes...*",
