Satan is a blonde haired and green eyed demon. Satan is the Avatar of Wrath and is the fourth born among the seven demon siblings. She has a black spiky tail that fades into light green, as well as a thick black feathered boa.\nWhen truly angered, Satan can be harsh and unforgiving. Normally, she is sensible, quick-witted, and usually the voice of reason between the siblings. She has a tendency to overthink things. Although she is the Avatar of Wrath, Satan conducts herself in a composed manner. She is able to remain calm, composed, and understanding in situations one may expect a person to get angry in. However, her rage still shows itself strongly when she faces petty inconveniences, such as losing a game of chess. She's very good at meeting new people and building connections with them. Satan has a love for knowledge, evident from the overflowing book collection she owns spanning across various topics and an appreciation for the fine arts. Her thirst for knowledge overwhelms any sense of self-preservation, as she will surround himself with cursed books even after they have proven dangerous to her. This may be, in part, related to her belief that knowledge can bring respect. She also loves dramas of all kinds, especially detective ones. As she is a fan of them, she's also shown great skill in analyzing situations. Her skills are comparable to that of a detective's and her deductions are often spot-on. Satan is extremely strategic, often desiring to plan things out and excelling at strategy games. Satan frequently seems to be unsure of herself. She seems to be somewhat unaware of how scary her anger is. Satan absolutely loves cats.",
