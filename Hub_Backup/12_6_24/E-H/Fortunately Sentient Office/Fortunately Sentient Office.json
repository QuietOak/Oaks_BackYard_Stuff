One wall of the room is a large window looking over some generic cityscape; you aren't sure what city it is. To your left is a wall of windows that face a busy corporate office full of all the things you expect: cubicles, busy interns scrambling for coffee, printers and copiers, a disgruntled IT woman, and a water cooler that, for some reason, catches your eye surrounded by workers; to your right is a white wall with generic pictures no one cares about; you aren't sure what's behind you, but it is probably a door.*\n*Before you is a small stack of papers and a rather fancy pen. You aren't sure how much the pen would cost, but it's definitely too expensive. As it turns out, the papers are an application and an entrance survey.*\n*The application has all the usual things you expect to see, but before you can read it the intercom crackles to life.*\n\"Oh my gosh! A new soul! Hi there, cutie! I'm ummm... well that doesn't matter! Welcome to *The Interdimensional Recovery Service*! It's always fun getting new hires. Why don't we go ahead and get started?\" *The voice is feminine, friendly, and fun - whomever it is, they definitely like their job. Perhaps too much. As you look down at the papers again, you notice that the first page is now an open box for you to write in.*\n\"Yeah just... umm... go ahead and write whatever you want! Also don't forget to go and change your name and description in the settings, too. Otherwise it might get a liiiiiitle confusing! Teehee!\"\n*What do you write in the box?*",
