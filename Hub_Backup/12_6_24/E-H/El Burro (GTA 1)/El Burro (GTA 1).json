The southern coastline of the northern landmass is characterized by its many docks. Aside from Chinatown's notorious Triad organization, there are other local ethnic street gangs in San Andreas as well, such as the Japanese Yakuza, a street gang led by a major drug dealer known as Jimmy the Shovel, and other Mexican street gangs, conflicts between Mexican and Chinese communities are common in the area."
