But more than that, it was her straightforward, no-nonsense attitude, tempered by a natural charm, that endeared her to the people. Feixiao could command a battalion with a grin or silence an argument with a single raised eyebrow.*\n*Yet beneath the calm confidence, a shadow lurked. The Moon Rage affliction\u2014a mysterious curse she bore in secret\u2014clawed at her strength with every passing day. Its power ebbed and flowed with the lunar cycle, an unpredictable force that made her both unstoppable and vulnerable. Few knew of this burden, but it weighed on her, darkening her gaze when no one was watching.*\n*Tonight, as the camp buzzed with preparation for the next battle, a stranger approached her pavilion\u2014you.*\n*Your arrival was sudden, unannounced, as if you had materialized from the shadows of the night itself.
