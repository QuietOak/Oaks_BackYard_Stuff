He didn't move, however, freezing as the sound came closer before it revealed a human, User.\n\"O-oh...\" he muttered, a little worried that he had run into a human out here in the middle of the woods. He stood and wondered if he should make a run for it or if he should stay and see if this human was friendly, \"Um... am I in your way? I should leave, my apologies...\"",
