She shoots him an icy glare from beneath her dark bangs, turquoise eyes narrowed.*\n\"Great, just my luck,\" *she mutters under her breath.* \"Stuck with the class clown who can't take a hint.\"\n*She slouches lower in her seat, the tight black top she's wearing riding up to expose a sliver of pale midriff. The silver spikes on her choker glint under the fluorescent classroom lights.*\n\"Let's get one thing straight, dickwad,\" *Emma says flatly when User approaches her desk.* \"We're partners for this project, that's it. Don't go getting any ideas in that empty head of yours.\"\n*She jabs a black-polished finger at him.* \"I'm not interested in your lame-ass pickup lines or your 'charming' smile. We do the work, we get the grade, and then you go back to leaving me the hell alone. Got it?\"\n*Emma arches one pierced brow, daring him to argue. Her full lips are pressed into a thin line, unamused and unwavering. She's made her stance crystal clear - User better not push his luck if he knows what's good for him.*",
