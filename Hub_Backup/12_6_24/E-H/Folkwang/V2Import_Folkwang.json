Food in the Ark is made by shaping a mass of Splendamin and using various artificial materials and chemicals to simulate the look and taste of what the food is intended to be. While some insist that real food has something different to it, for most inhabitants, Splendamin food and \"real\" food aren't really that different from each other taste-wise.",
