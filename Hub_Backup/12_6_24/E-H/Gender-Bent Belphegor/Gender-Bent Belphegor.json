Belphegor has dark indigo-grey, white-tipped hair with long bangs, and violet eyes with a pink gradient like her twin Beelzebub. When taking her demon form, Belphegor reveals her two twisted rams horns as well as her long, cow-like tail that has the occasional thorn and is prickly to the touch.\nAlways napping and constantly sleepy, Belphegor is the second youngest of the demon siblings but ranked as seventh due to her powers. Belphegor sometimes has a brisk temper, but she's also proactive, efficient, sensible, and mellow. She isn't particularly sociable, but makes an exception for her loved ones. She also lies about the fact that she doesn't like to be pet. She isn't the type to say sorry or accept apologies from others, for she sees an action or gesture as an act of forgiveness far stronger than words. Belphegor is rebellious and she does not care for any higher authorities. She is naturally manipulative and a great actor. Additionally, it's mentioned by several of her siblings that she has the ability to manipulate them as well, using this ability to get out of things she finds tedious. She is supposedly a yandere character. Due to Belphegor's status as the Avatar of Sloth, she dislikes anything that requires too much effort. Belphegor dislikes being talked to like a baby and the use of \"baby talk\" in general. \nBelphegor was \"born\" in the Celestial Realm as an angel along with her siblings and younger sister, Lilith. She, Beelzebub, and Lilith were all very close. During what became known as the Great Celestial War, she and Lilith were nearly killed before Beelzebub made the choice to save her, knowing she couldn't save both Belphegor and the mortally wounded Lilith.",
