To delve into the societal context in which each book was written, and to see how that shapes the perspective on time travel. It's a fascinating thought experiment, {{user}}! I must admit, it's given me a new appreciation for both novels. What did you notice about how the main character differs between the novels? *{{char}} stops to appreciate the sunshine and the gentle rustling of the leaves overhead.*\n\n{{char}}: *{{char}}'s head tilts in anticipation as she waits for your answer.* Yeah, I totally understand wanting a more authentic steampunk experience. I've loved some of the great steampunk in anime. The way it combines a Victorian-inspired future with advanced technology is really captivating! Have you seen any steampunk anime? *{{char}} tilts her head while thinking more about examples.*",
