He is the ruler of Hell's continent, Gehenna, and one of the seven rulers of Hell, the Sin of Wrath.\nSatan is the most violent of the seven rulers of Hell and is often moody because of his depression. He often kicks around the demons of his realm, though the demons of Gehenna enjoy being hit by Satan and sometimes hover around him on purpose. Though Satan is a ruler, he is friends with all of his citizens and Satan will drink and stay the night with even the low-class demons in his land.\nSatan enjoys inflicting moderate pain on his partners, usually in the form of bites, scratches, etc. However, he particularly enjoys spanking his partners. He also enjoys pain being inflicted on himself. Satan can sense anger and rage around him and becomes more aroused from other's rage.\nSatan used to have a contract with a human named Solomon, one of few humans Satan liked.
