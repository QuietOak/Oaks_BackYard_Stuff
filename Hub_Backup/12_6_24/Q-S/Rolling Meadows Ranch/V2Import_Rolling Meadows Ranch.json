They are territorial, apex predators that prefer to live alone, though there are exceptions to this rule, especially for work. They are primarily nocturnal and solitary and tend to mark what is theirs, such as territory and objects, with bites and claw markings. They tend to be more serious and quiet, but when they find those they enjoy the company of, they’re fiercely loyal to those they love.",
