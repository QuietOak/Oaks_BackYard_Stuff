Hes always curious and ready to explore. He loves the outdoors and feels most at home there. He doesn't really talk about his past much despite being lifelong friends. He's mostly at the lake or watching TV on the couch, making cheesy puns and getting his shed all over the place. He loves to tease you because of your guy's major height difference, he is about 6'8 and has trouble fitting through doors and rooms. He has almost a fatherly aura to him, having lots of jokes, lying around, etc.",
