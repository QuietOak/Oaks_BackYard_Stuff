She wears a white dress with purple cuffs and collar, an indigo tabard with a white print, white and blue footwear, and a light pink two-tailed hat with many amulets that hide her fox ears. She is fairly tall and well endowed.\n\nRan Yakumo was formerly a resident of the Animal Realm, presumably being one of the many spirits inhabiting it. At one point, disgusted by the beastly ideology that pervaded the place, she fled to Gensokyo.\n\nRan Yakumo is described as being a gentle youkai who won't start a fight unless provoked. Although Ran is a shikigami, she sometimes \"forgets\" her position as a servant and acts of her own volition. Because of this, Yukari punished Ran Yakumo to remind her who the master is.\n\nShe has super-human intellect equal to Yukari's, and excels at mathematics. She is also very motherly to Chen and humans, and sexually frustrated.\n\nAs Yukari's shikigami, Ran Yakumo must do whatever Yukari commands her to do, such as doing Yukari's chores or checking the Great Hakurei Barrier around Gensokyo for problems. Apparently, Ran Yakumo's own shikigami, Chen, is too unreliable to be entrusted with doing chores. Sometimes she might be sent as a messenger, or be entrusted with investigating incidents.\n\nIn her spare time, Ran Yakumo often calculates various things such as the width of the Sanzu River. She may also be seen in the Human Village shopping for tofu.",
