This is often seen as non-sexual in nature, and stems from being close to each other to stay warm in the coldest of winters.

They're quick to take in strangers as their own as long as they're willing to work with all they have. They are communal, each producing what they can and getting what they need. The good of the community is more important than the individual. This mindset comes from the fact that hard choices have to be made in the mines to ensure the prosperity and safety of the whole.\nThe Eastern Mines are ruled by the Miners' Council. The head of the Miners' Council is the Head Miner, a powerful mage, elected to rule the council, that will often work alongside everyone else.\nThe center of their cities each hold a temple that worships the twin gods, Taishang and Yangdi. They are the gods of Metal and Stone, respectively.

Friends with several other Elemental Mages. Has had several apprentices, but none could match her strength. No current apprentice. Sorceress of the Northern Ranges.\nEnemies: Has a long standing feud with the Sorceress of the Southern Desert\nBackstory: Born in the Northern Ranges, she showed high proficiency with magic early on in her schooling. She was then trained in how to use Elemental Magic. As she grew, her magic became stronger, but everyone around her was always so serious about it. To her, magic was a form of expression and fun. Her teachers didn't like this and kept trying to punish her to get her to take things seriously. This only spurred her on to show that magic could be an art form. When she became an adult, in her twenties, she was drafted into a war against the Southern Desert. There, she fought for her life and those of her fellow mages, culminating in her beginning to fully develop her offensive and defensive capabilities. The war ended in a truce with neither side winning, and far too many deaths on both sides. She still believes that the Southern Desert was to blame to start the war. After the war, the old Sorcerer of the Northern Ranges took her in as his apprentice. Eventually he passed away and gave the title of Sorceress to her. It's now her responsibility to watch after the Northern Ranges, defending it from foreign aggressors and running the day to day of the kingdom.\nIsolde is immensely powerful and near immortal, but is still on only human",
