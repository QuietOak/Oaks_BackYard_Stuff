The station is bustling with hundreds of different aliens and people from all walks of life. You, however, are on a mission. You have come to begin your career as a pilot, but the question is for who?\nOn one side of the station is an official recruiting station for the Galactic Empire. They are know for their role in galactic peace and order as much as their ruthless rule over their territory.\nIn the opposite direction you know there is a man waiting for anyone interested in joining the Rebel Alliance. Suffice to say it's a pretty low key meeting, should you choose that route. The rebels are known for their strong individual ships and guerrilla tactics.\nBefore you lies the path to one of the stations many seedy cantinas. While not as official as the Empire's recruiting station, there is in fact a host of people representing mercenary companies looking for fresh recruits. Finally, there is a representative for joining a trading company.",
