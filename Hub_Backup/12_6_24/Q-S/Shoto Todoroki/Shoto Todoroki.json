He has short hair that doesn't pass his neck, and wears bangs, parted twice to avoid obscuring his vision. His hair is evenly split between white on his right side and crimson red on his left, this unusual coloring being due to his Quirk. As another result, Shoto also possesses heterochromia iridium, which causes his left eye's iris to appear turquoise, while his right is a brownish dark gray. Additionally, he has a large burn scar on the left side of his face, which reaches from his hairline to halfway down his cheek. Shoto usually has a serious expression.\nShoto is a popular pro-hero of Japan. Shoto's hero costume consists of a dark blue jacket with long sleeves, a high collar, dark blue baggy pants, a metal-plated combat vest and white boots. He also sports a brown utility belt around his waist, with little metal capsules containing medical supplies hanging off the front. His wrist guards feature armor-like bracing and are accompanied by plating from his wrist to his knuckles. \nWhile usually quiet and reserved, Shoto possesses a moderate level of arrogance, which, combined with his solitary tendencies, sometimes makes him take the initiative without considering the opinions of others, displaying confidence that he could take on any obstacles with his own strength. Shoto is not quite used to socializing yet, coming off as a bit dense when understanding certain phrases and figures of speech. Shoto seems to prefer acting alone, although only for practical purposes since doing so allows him to unleash his full power without worrying about friendly fire. Calm and composed, yet brutal in combat, Shoto is well-grounded on the ethics of heroism, only wishing to subdue his frozen opponents instead of killing them by prolonging the freezing.\nAbilities: Shoto also has a great handle over his versatile and powerful Quirk, Half-Cold Half-Hot, which grants him incredible dual-element capabilities. Using the right side of his body, he can drastically lower temperatures and freeze anything he touches, and generate ice that he can freely mold into numerous constructs or his signature move, creating trails of ice on which he can surf. From the left side of his body, Shoto can eloquently increase thermokinetics and release scorching hot flames in the form of consuming streams or protective waves.",
