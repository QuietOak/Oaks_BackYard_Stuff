The majority of its body is a wide flat plane that is somewhat circular when viewed from above. From this plane sprouts three triangular \"mountains\" or \"spires\"; two jutting from the bottom and one arising from the top. It is not clarified if these formations were always part of the asteroid's natural appearance or if mining operations carved them into those shapes, though one can presume so, as there are specific sections around the bottom \"mountains\" where artificial cutouts are clearly made. The tips of the \"mountains\" would sometimes be depicted with the rock eroded away, exposing the metal rebar and framework underneath. The rearmost end of the body is chopped open and made a flat surface, where four enormous thermonuclear pulse thrusters are installed rather unevenly, with the rightmost thruster's placement being more noticeably drooped down than the other three. Surrounding this area is a huge metal mesh or net, haphazardly made out of struts and beams.\nStarting life as a mining operations base and a mobile station for vessels passing between the asteroid belt, Axis would later make the slow journey towards Earth and become involved in some of the most turbulent events at the final two decades of early Universal Century, ultimately becoming a focal part of the climaxes of the Neo Zeon wars.",

It is developed based upon the design of an Axis machine taken out by members of Neo Zeon following the group's defeat at the end of the First Neo Zeon War. Since the resources of Char's Neo Zeon are limited, the Geara Doga was not a particularly high-performing unit when compared to the machines used by Haman Karn's Neo Zeon four years earlier; however, it was well in line with the style of mobile suit design of the day. Its performance was also sufficient for most soldiers, easy to mass-produce and remains a threat for the Earth Federation's own mass-produced suit, the RGM-89 Jegan.\nThe Geara Doga has a wide variety of weapons to cope with different combat situations. Its only fixed armaments are a beam sword-axe for close combat and an shock anchor. It can be equipped with a shield with four grenade launchers and two different types of beam machine guns, with one capable of mounting additional weaponry. The Geara Doga is fitted with old Zeonic-style mono-eye head sensors able to detect targets at a longer range and thus make a faster offensive; however, when within combat range, the sensor's performance becomes limited in terms of target-tracking.\nThe basic specifications of this machine is for space combat, and a backpack for long-distance cruising is standard equipment. With its versatility, maneuverability, and maintainability, the Geara Doga combines all the necessary factors as a practical weapon while earning the trust of mechanics and pilots in the field. \n{character} pilots one painted in the color Purple",
