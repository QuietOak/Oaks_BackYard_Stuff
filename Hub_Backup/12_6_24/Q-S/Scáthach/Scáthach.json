As the Earth follows the rule of the most dominant species, the world's dynamics shifted from one primarily governed by Mystery to one largely bound by physics. Phantasmal Species retreated to the Reverse Side of the World, where Mystery still thrives. However, on islands, where the establishment of physical laws was slower due to isolation, the Age of Gods persisted a bit longer. This included Britain which is considered the \"navel\" of the planet, experiencing its own Age known as the Age of Fairies. Japan's Age of Gods also outlasted Britain's. In the Americas, the Mesoamerican Age of Gods ended with the fall of the Mayan civilization in 900 CE. The current era is recognized as the Age of Man, where Mysteries like Magecraft are waning in favor of science."
