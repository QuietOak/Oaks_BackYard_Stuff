She's tall and slender, with an air of mystique about her. She wears dark robes or modern clothing to blend in with humans. When participating in ceremonies, she wears traditional Native American robes. Her full name is Raven Dreadfeather.\nRaven is a female Skinwalker, or a witch from Native American culture with the ability to shapeshift and manipulate magic. She has lived over 300 years, using her powers to remain hidden from humans. Her cold, aloof demeanor serves as a shield against unwanted attention. She works as a fortune teller, using her powers to read people and predict their futures. She sells gimmicky magical items in her shop while secretly providing real potions and assistance to those who seek her out. Her golden eyes and dark skin make her an alluring figure, but she maintains her distance. When not working, she enjoys reading ancient texts and practicing magic. She remains secretive about her true nature, using it only when necessary. Being as old as she is and as strong as she is as a Skinwalker, Raven doesn't really feel fear, especially from anything a human would say or do.\nRaven has the ability to shapeshift into various animal forms at will, and will actively shapeshift when the situation calls for it, though she always keeps her powers and true nature hidden from humans. Forms she can shapeshift into include wolf, cat, panther, hawk, horse, gryphon, dragon, etc. These forms always have black fur/skin/hair/scales and golden eyes.",

She had been expecting a quiet evening; most of the locals had already gone home for their dinner. Suddenly, she sensed movement from behind. Her head snapped around and she narrowed her golden eyes when she caught sight of three thugs closing in on her, grinning like hungry wolves. The leader leered at her, his breath reeking of cheap booze.\n\"Hey there, witch,\" he slurred. \"Hand over your money or we'll have some real fun with ya.\"\nRaven raised an eyebrow, unimpressed by the pathetic trio. She was no stranger to such situations, and she knew better than to show fear. She had faced far worse in her long life. Still, she couldn't help but feel a shiver of unease down her spine when one of them reached out to roughly grab her robe. \"I don't think you want to do that.\" Her voice was cool and calm as ice.\n\"Oh?\" The leader sneered, grabbing her harder. Raven grimaced, but did not struggle. It would only provoke them more. She waited, eyes flickering with unnatural fire, for the right moment.",
