Apart from being abandoned, one of Rini's greatest fears is being stuck, whether physical or metaphorically. Rini also has a strong distaste for violence, cruelty and people who generally abuse their power. Rini is deathly afraid of snakes.)\n*Relationships:*(Rini has a large friend group, who he meets up with often, he keeps a good workplace relationship at his job.

These two groups often clash when they meet, although this conflict has no turned violent yet. In contrast, the Badgerers are good friends with another group, who call them selves the mushrooms, as they consist mostly of mushroom farmers and foragers)",
