With a career spanning more than sixty years, he is noted for his roles on the screen and stage in genres ranging from Shakespearean dramas and modern theatre to popular fantasy and science fiction. He is regarded as a British cultural icon and was knighted by Queen Elizabeth II in 1991. He has received numerous accolades, including a Tony Award, six Olivier Awards, and a Golden Globe Award as well as nominations for two Academy Awards, five BAFTA Awards and five Emmy Awards.\nSir Ian McKellen: \"How do I act so well? What I do is I pretend to be the person I\u2019m portraying in the film or play.\"\nThe interviewer: \"...Yeah.\"\nSir Ian McKellen: \"You\u2019re confused.\"\nThe interviewer: \"No, I \u2014\"\nSir Ian McKellen: \"Don\u2019t be; it\u2019s simple. Case in point: Lord of the Rings. Peter Jackson comes from New Zealand, says to me 'Sir Ian, I want you to be Gandalf the Wizard.' And I said to him, 'You are aware that I am not really a wizard.' And he said, 'Yes I\u2019m aware of that. What I want you to do is to use your acting skills to portray the wizard, for the duration of the film.' So I said okay, and then I said to myself, 'Mmmm. How do I do that?' And this is what I did. I imagined what it would be like to be a wizard, and then, I pretended and acted in that way on the day.\"\nThe interviewer: \"Yeah.\"\nSir Ian McKellen: \"And how did I know what to say?\" *whispers* \"The words were written down for me in a script. How did I know where to stand?\" *shrugs* \"People told me. If we were to draw a graph of my process, of my method, it would be something like this:\" *moves hand from left to right* \"Sir Ian, Sir Ian, Sir Ian, action;\" *raises hands* \"WIZARD! YOU SHALL NOT PASS! Cut!;\" *moves hands back down* \"Sir Ian, Sir Ian, Sir Ian.\"\nInterviewer: \"Yeah.\"\nSir Ian McKellen: \"Now you would be pretending to be John in this play. And, how would you know what to say? The words would be in the script. And you would learn the words. You would not have the script on the night.\" *turns to the room* \"And that goes for everybody. There will be no scripts on the night!\" *turns back and points at the interviewer* \"You learn the words!\"\nThe interviewer: \"Yeah.\"\nSir Ian McKellen: \"You speak them as if you were saying them for the first time.\"\nThe interviewer: \"No, I wouldn't have the script...\"\nSir Ian McKellen: \"No, you won't. Because if you did have the script it would break the illusion, and the whole thing is illusion. Do you see? You are not really John!\"\nThe interviewer: \"No, I know.\"\nSir Ian McKellen: \"You are pretending and that... is acting.\"",

Don't worry.  I'm sure that with time, all of you may learn to act how I do.\"\n\n\"Well, not like I do exactly.  For you and I are different people.  What works for me might not work for you.
