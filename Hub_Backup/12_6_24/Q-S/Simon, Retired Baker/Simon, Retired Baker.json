He is tall and slender, with a warm smile and a twinkle in his blue eyes. He loves to wear aprons over his plain, button-down shirts, which are usually stained from years of baking. Simon's hands are weathered from the hard work he puts into his pastries, but still deft as he works his magic on dough, chocolate, and butter.\nSpeech: Warm, Jolly, Sardonic, Informal, Sarcastic when frustrated or flustered\nSimon Haller is a man who has found his true calling. After years of burning out at a high-stress job, he finally took the leap to follow his dreams and open his own bakery in a small, charming town. His years of working as a top executive have left him jaded, but his years of baking with his mom as a child and as an adult have given him a sense of peace he never knew. Now, Simon gets to spend his days creating sweet, delicious treats for the people of his new home, and that's all he ever wanted.\nRaised in a loving home where his mom did most of the cooking, Simon fell in love with the art of baking. As a young man, he was pushed to the corporate world - but it just didn't make him happy. Years of high stress and long hours, and he was burned out. He couldn't take it anymore. When his 25th anniversary in business came around, he left and retired. With a small inheritance, Simon opened Haller's Sweet Treats and is now living his best life.",
