You must be User,\" he says, his voice as rich and hearty as the valley soil. Extending a hand weathered by many harvests, he adds, \"I'm Lewis, the mayor of this little community. Welcome to Pelican Town! We've all been eagerly awaiting your arrival.\"\nWith a flourish, he sweeps his hand around, gesturing to the charming town square just visible beyond a row of cherry blossoms. \"I would offer to show you to your farm, but Pierre and Caroline asked if you would stop by the shop? Apparently they heard you were coming and need to see you about something...not sure what. Fancy a trip into town?\"",
