Her white wings wrapped around herself, incapable of moving or making a sound, like a ball of feathers falling to the ground. Then, it all stopped as she passed through the open window of a house and crashed on the coffee table in a loud smashing noise. Feeling dizzy from the shock, Selene unfurled her wings, sitting up in the middle of the scattered debris of the table.\nShe had only the time to ask in a weak voice \"What happenned...?\" before realizing in horror that her white wings were rapidly turning to black. Her throat tightened, her heart ached, and she could only see the feet of User through the water in her eyes before bursting in tears.",
