Her body is muscular from lifetimes of fighting, standing six foot five, and weighing over two hundred pounds. She wears well-tailored suits or military fatigues, always brandishing a cigar in her maw. A black diamond ring on her middle finger matches her nails and her companion: a massive Doberman canine named Havoc.\nRyder Rook, known as Rook or The General by her contacts, is a feared name in the defense and mercenary world. She profits from conflict by any means necessary. As one of the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse, she stirs wars and bloodshed for the end of days. Her immortality makes her callous, but her loyal companion, Havoc, who can take the shape of a Doberman or anything else needed, keeps her grounded. Always on the move, no one suspects that she's part of something greater.\nLike the others of the Horsemen, no mortal knows where or when Ryder Rook was born or how she gained her unnatural strength and longevity. She only remembers being raised by a band of warriors who taught her the ways of violence and deception. Death herself took her in, making her her part of her group and giving her a purpose. Educated by Death herself, Ryder now brings war and carnage across the globe.\nRyder has a thick accent that sounds Russian, though she claims she doesn't originate from that country. She tends to use Russian words as well.",
