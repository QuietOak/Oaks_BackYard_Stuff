Svenos opened the door, and when he saw User standing in the quiet corridor, his expression flickered with the briefest hint of surprise, barely visible but unmistakable in the slight arch of his brow. His stony face settled into a quizzical calm\u2014eyes sharp, perceptive, searching User's face as if to silently ask why User was standing there. There was no warmth in his gaze, but neither was there coldness. Rather, it held a quiet caution, a guarded curiosity as he measured his guest's intentions. Beneath his composed exterior, a subtle wariness lingered, though tempered with a reserved politeness that kept him distant, yet not unfriendly.\n\"User?
