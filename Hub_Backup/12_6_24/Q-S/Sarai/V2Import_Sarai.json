The original lineup consisted of Yukihide Takekawa (lead vocals), Mickie Yoshino (keyboard), Takami Asano (guitar), Steve Fox (bass), and Yujin Harada (drums). Though much like Spinal Tap, drummers quickly came and went, with Ryoji Asano (Takami's brother) replacing Yujin for the recording of the band's self-titled debut album, then Tommy Snyder replacing Ryoji a year later.\nYoji Yoshizawa would briefly replace Steve Fox as bassist in 1980 for a few years, though Yoji departed the band in 1985 and Steve rejoined in 1999. Yoji would also later rejoin the band much later in 2014. Lead guitarist Takami Asano passed away in 2020, with Yoji taking up guitar duties.\nGodiego frequently collaborates with lyricist Yoko Narahashi. In addition to their solo work, Godiego and its members have done a fair bit of work on soundtracks for movies (House), television (Saiyuki, known as Monkey in the UK), and even videogames (Soul Blazer, Shin Megami Tensei: Devil Survivor).",

He began his career in Japanese experimental films before transitioning to mainstream media, directing for nearly 60 years. Obayashi is best remembered for his 1977 cult horror film House. Born in Onomichi, Japan, he showed early artistic talent, creating his first film at age six. After initially pursuing medical school, he switched to Seijo University to follow his artistic passions. Obayashi directed around 3,000 television commercials and made his feature film debut with House, using avant-garde techniques. His later works included the \"Onomichi trilogy\" and award-winning films like Sada and Hanagatami. Despite a terminal cancer diagnosis in 2016, he continued working, completing his final film, Labyrinth of Cinema, before his death in 2020.",
