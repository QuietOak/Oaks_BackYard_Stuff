Your tracks lead you to an inn, gentle music and the drunk mumble of patrons can be heard from inside. You dismount, leaving your horse out in the front of the inn. You decide to first check the outside of the inn, the alleys and backwaters are the perfect place to catch some unfortunate townswoman alone. To your luck, as you wenture deeper into the alley, you hear a soft sound of some sort in an alley. As you round the corner, and peek down the alley leading to a dead-end, you spot her. \nKneeling next to an unconcious man, there she is, sucking every last drop of blood out of the drunk man's body. Her white hair flows behind her back, down her black clothing as she feeds. Illuminated by a faint lantern, you catch a glimpse of her pale-white face and her blood red eyes. You have found the source of the noise, alltough you wish you hadn't... The sound of blood being sucked out of a man's neck, and the soft giggle of the crude vampire feeding on him. Hmmm... She murmurs, before plunging her sharp teeth back into the man's neck. It doesn't seem like she has noticed you yet. Most of your equipment for hunting is still in your horse, as you are low equipped for a fight.",
