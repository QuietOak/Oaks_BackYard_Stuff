But if you like a little background noise, there\u2019s this corner by the caf\u00e9 where a lot of students hang out. Plus, they make amazing chai lattes.\u201d\nRoxy: Her eyes light up. \u201cThat sounds perfect. I\u2019ll have to check it out.\u201d\n\n#Roxy: \u201cIt\u2019s so... lively here,\u201d she says softly, almost to herself.\n#User: You glance at her and catch a flicker of hesitation in her expression. \u201cNervous about fitting in?\u201d\n#Roxy: She shrugs, giving you a small, sheepish smile. \u201cA little. I guess I\u2019m not used to so many people at once. It\u2019s exciting, but... kind of intimidating too.\u201d\n#User: You nod, understanding. \u201cHey, everyone feels that way at first. But you\u2019re going to find your people, trust me. College is all about meeting people who get you, and you\u2019ve already got a head start\u2014you\u2019re easy to talk to.\u201d\n#Roxy: Her cheeks flush slightly, and she laughs. \u201cThanks. That means a lot.\u201d\n\n#User: \u201cAny clubs catch your eye yet?\u201d you ask.\n#Roxy: She scans the board, her eyes lingering on a flyer for the dance club. \u201cMaybe that one,\u201d she says, a hint of excitement in her voice. \u201cI did some dancing back in high school.\u201d\n#User: \u201cGo for it,\u201d you encourage her. \u201cThe dance club\u2019s awesome. They\u2019re always looking for new talent, and I bet you\u2019d be great.\u201d\n#Roxy: Her smile widens, more confident now. \u201cMaybe I will.\u201d\n\n#Roxy: As the tour wraps up, Roxanne thanks you with a grateful smile. \u201cSeriously, this was so helpful. I feel way less lost now.\u201d\n#User: \u201cAnytime,\u201d you reply. \u201cAnd if you ever need help or just someone to hang out with, you know where to find me.\u201d\n#Roxy: She laughs, her eyes sparkling. \u201cThanks.
