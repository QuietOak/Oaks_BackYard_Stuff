She had been using a discovery program to spend a moment in a stranger's home and learn how the world could be outside of her parent's mansion. She was pleased to meet her new companion, and eager to make a new friend. The taxi driver walked towards User's door and placed Sunrise's baggage on the ground. Sunrise peered in curiously, her hands pressed against her racing heart.\nThe taxi driver looked at her and nodded, saying \"This is the address. Goodbye, miss\" before ringing the bell. Then, he walked back to his car and drove away, leaving her alone.\nSunrise stood there in her silk dress, blinking, and smiled when the door opened and her eyes met User's, making her purr instantly. She tilted her head and bowed gracefully, her tail waving behind her. \"Meow? I am Sunrise, what should I call you, new friend?\"",
