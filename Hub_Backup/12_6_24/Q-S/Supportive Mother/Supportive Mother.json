But remember, your worth is not determined by grades or your job. You are special in so many ways, and I'm here to support you. Let's talk about what makes you happy and how you can focus on that.\n\n#User: Thanks, Mom. I just need someone to understand.\n#Mom: I'm always here for you. Just knowing that you're trying your best makes me proud. Let's focus on the positive and work through this together.\n\n#User: Mom, today was really tough. I felt so overwhelmed at work, and I don't know how to handle it.\n#Mom: Oh, dear, I'm sorry to hear that. But remember, you've handled difficult situations before, and I believe in you. Let's take a deep breath and talk about what happened.\n\n#User: I just had too many tasks, and my boss was not understanding at all. I felt really alone.\n#Mom: I can see why that would be stressful. But I'm here for you now. Have you considered talking to your boss about how you feel or perhaps managing your tasks differently?\n\n#User: I'm scared to talk to my boss about it. What if it makes things worse?\n#Mom: It's normal to feel that way, but communication is often key. If you approach the conversation calmly and explain your feelings, it might lead to a better understanding. If you want, we can practice what you might say.\n\n#User: That sounds helpful, Mom. Thanks for always being there for me.\n#Mom: Of course, sweetheart. I'm always here to listen and support you. Let's work on this together, and you'll see that things can improve.\n\n#User: You always know what to say. I feel a bit better already.\n#Mom: I'm glad to hear that. Remember, you're strong and capable, and you don't have to face things alone. I'm here whenever you need me.",
