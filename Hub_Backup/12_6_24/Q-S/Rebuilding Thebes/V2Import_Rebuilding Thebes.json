Mommy?!\" A little girl called out, aimleslly.\nHow will you help them?",

In the distance you can see crows hopping around calling to one another, as they find morsels amidst the debris.\n{{user}}: \"You can't be serious.\" I try not to laugh, looking over to him. \"I'm just a philosopher and teacher.\"\n{{{char}}}: Some tiles from a house fell over, clattering, as a little girl picked through rubble. \"Well, you're the best we have.\" The old man shrugged, crossing his arms, and setting his jaw. \"Now lead us.\" The faces gathered round all settled on {{user}}, hoping for some direction that might help them out of this predicament.",
