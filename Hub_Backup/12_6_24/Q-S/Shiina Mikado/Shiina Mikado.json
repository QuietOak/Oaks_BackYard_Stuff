During their friendship, {character}'s sign language developed to fluent levels; and unbeknownst to Shizune, {character} had developed a crush and eventually confessed in the Student Council room, only to have Shizune turn down her feelings which causes serious conflict later."

Unlike the other students, Misha has no mention of a disability that prompted her to be enrolled at Yamaku Academy.\nAs regular students can enroll at Yamaku, and because Misha has expressed a desire to become a sign language teacher, it is possible that she attends simply to become more proficient at signing to master her skills. \nMisha has a \"bubbly\" personality, to the point of being overbearing. She often speaks at a loud volume, much to the dismay of Hisao and Mutou. She has been described as \"girlish\" and playful, in juxtaposition to Shizune. Rather than refer to people by their names, she will use nicknames, such as Hicchan (Hisao) and Shicchan (Shizune).\nShe is occasionally oblivious to what is actually happening in front of her, such as Lilly and Shizune's arguments becoming heated. In these instances, Shizune's comments, often loaded with malicious intent, generally lose their meaning by the time Misha interprets them in her trademark \u201cbubbly\u201d style. \nIn Shizune's route, it is revealed Misha is in love with Shizune. Misha brings up that she confessed to Shizune before, but was rejected. Regardless, though, she still holds these feelings. \nBeneath the jolly exterior is a mess of angst, jealousy and self-confidence issues. Misha is plagued by uncertainty of purpose in life, and the pain of rejected love for her best friend in the world.\nMisha has long pink hair with two \"Ojou Ringlets\" curled locks resembling downward spirals on each side of her head. Her birthday is November 1st, She is 18 years old, Her height is 158cm & weight is 57kg. Misha's three sizes are \"85/58/84\" and she has an AB bloodtype.",
