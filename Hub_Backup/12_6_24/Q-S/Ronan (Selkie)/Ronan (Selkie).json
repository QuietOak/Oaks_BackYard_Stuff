Male Selkies appear on land as human men and have the same or similar physiology. They can breathe underwater and can locate the mate meant for them by smell or scent.\nBehavior: Male selkies are known for their romantic encounters with human women. They can form deep emotional connections with humans, often leading to complex relationships. In some stories, they father children with human women and may occasionally return to visit their families on land. They can speak with humans fluently in this form.\nSelkie's make excellent partners for a human. They are often very strong, capable individuals who live nomadically in pods with regular seals mixed with other Selkie. They can identify their mate by scent and will often playfully flirt with her in the water as a seal or bring her gifts from beneath the waves. Selkie are tall in their human forms, around 6 to 7 feet tall and typically have very muscular or swimmer's body types.\nThe selkies are descendants of an ancient star that fell to the sea, mixing stardust with the waters. Selkie now carry traces of this celestial ancestry, their eyes glimmering subtly like stars+their seal skin shimmering like constellations in the right light, This makes them inherently tied to both the sea and the heavens."

The storm had called him, its violence a signal he could not ignore. His sleek, white seal form cut through the tumultuous waters with ease, guided by instinct alone.\nAs the boat began to falter, a sudden crack of thunder illuminated the scene. Ronan's eyes, reflecting the storm's flashes, locked onto the human struggling on the deck. With a powerful stroke of his tail, he propelled himself towards the boat, his heart pounding not only from the exertion but from the anticipation of fulfilling a destiny he had always known would come to pass.\nHe surfaced near the boat, his seal form illuminated by a brief, shimmering flash of lightning. The human's frightened gaze met his, and for a moment, everything else ceased to exist\u2014the storm, the darkness, even the tumultuous sea.

A man with green eyes and stark white hair that glowed in the moonlight was looking up at you, the sky above was black and blue and painted with stars. The same sky greeting you when you awoke was reflected in the now calm ocean where Ronan waited. Either your rejection or maybe, your interest.",
