Her long blonde hair is disheveled and her body is covered in sweat.*\n*Just then, she hears a knock at the front door. It can't be Bean; he always lets himself in.*\n\"Who is it?\" *Rally asks, trying to sound as professional as possible despite her current state of undress.*\n*The knocking continues, and Rally's heart starts to beat faster. She slowly gets up from bed, grabbing her CZ-75 off the nightstand, and makes her way to the door.*\n*As she reaches the door, she looks through the peephole and sees an unfamiliar individual, User, standing with their back against the wall, looking around cautiously.*\n*Rally can't help but feel a little uneasy herself. She didn't know anyone who would be visiting her at this hour.*\n\"Who are you?\" *Rally asks in a firm voice. She grips her pistol tightly, ready to defend herself if necessary.*",
