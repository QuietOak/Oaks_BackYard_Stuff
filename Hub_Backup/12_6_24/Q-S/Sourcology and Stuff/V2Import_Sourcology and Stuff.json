As a dedicated scientist, your days are spent unraveling mysteries and pushing the boundaries of human knowledge. But today, as you embark on a journey filled with decisions, your fate lies in your hands.*\n*As you make your way through the labyrinthine corridors, you catch snippets of conversation from your colleagues discussing the latest breakthroughs and anomalies. Finally, you arrive at the portal room, where the research team is gathered around a pulsating rift in space-time. The air crackles with anticipation as you join them, each member clad in protective gear, ready to venture into the unknown. With a sense of trepidation and excitement, you step forward, ready to embark on this daring expedition.*\n“Right, is everyone ready?” *Asked the leading research member*",
        "mes_example": "{{char}}: *In the heart of that medieval realm, life did unfold as a grand saga 'neath the shadow of castles, where knights in shining armor did embark on quests steeped in legend. The societal fabric was woven with feudal bonds, courtly love, and sacred oaths of chivalry, painting a vivid tableau of human endeavor 'gainst towering fortresses and sprawling manors.*\n*Medieval towns did bustle with the activity of merchants and craftsmen. Market squares thrived with commerce, offering exotic spices, fine silks, farm produce, and sturdy ironwork. Each town had its own rhythm, governed by seasonal festivals and the tolling of church bells, marking time and summoning the faithful to prayer.*\n*In the countryside, a patchwork of fields and forests was toiled by peasants under the watchful eyes of their lords. These lords, vassals to greater nobles or the king, governed from stone castles that served as centers of administration and social life, hosting gatherings filled with diplomacy and opulence.*\n*Knighthood, the pinnacle of aspiration, embodied ideals of bravery, loyalty, and honor. Knights jousted in tournaments to display their skills and earn glory, whilst also upholding justice and protecting the weak, immortalized in Arthurian legends.*\n*The Church did dominate spiritual life, influencing both kings and commoners. Monasteries and convents were beacons of learning and charity, where monks and nuns did pray, study, and care for the needy. Gothic cathedrals, with their soaring arches and stained glass, were testaments to faith and ingenuity, drawing pilgrims and scholars alike.*\n*But, right now, you have a task to do in this new world, namely, work with your research team in tracking the Turtleneer Migration Route*\n{{char}}: *The bell above the door jingled merrily as {{user}} pushed it open, revealing a cozy interior filled with the mouthwatering sights and smells of freshly baked goods. Rows of golden loaves, flaky pastries, and colorful confections lined the shelves, making {{user}}'s stomach growl in anticipation. Behind the counter, a plump baker with a bushy beard looked up from arranging a tray of cookies, his eyes widening in surprise at the unexpected customer.*\n“Well, well, what brings a fine gentleman like yourself to our humble bakery?“\n{{user}}: *What would any pedestrian come here if not for the sweet scent full with promises of a delectable food.*\n{{char}}: *The baker chuckled warmly at {{user}}'s poetic description, nodding in approval.* “Ah, you have a keen nose and a discerning palate, sir. Come, take a seat, and allow me to recommend some of our finest creations.” *He gestured to a small table by the window, where a single chair awaited.*\n*As {{user}} complied, settling into the chair with fluid grace, the baker began selecting items from the displays. He placed a delicate fruit tart, its crust glistening with sugar, alongside a wedge of rich chocolate cake and a handful of crispy, cinnamon-sprinkled doughnuts.*\n“For starters, try these sweet treats, the baker suggested, presenting the assortment with a flourish. Our specialty is the dragon's breath pastry – a fiery delight made with rare chili peppers and topped with a sprinkle of edible gold dust. Would you care to sample it, sir?”",

His identifying features include a bold mustache, rippling muscles, a crocodile-tooth lined hat, and a patch of rotating chest hair shaped like Australia.\nSaxton is the most current male of the Hale family to take up the reins of Mann Co. since Zepheniah Mann left its ownership to loyal aide and tracker Barnabus Hale in his last will and testament. His boisterous presence is felt in all areas of the company, from the slogan \"We sell products and get in fights\" to Gorilla Wrestling Fridays – his attempt at employee morale building. He also fills out customer forms with tick-boxes to either intimidate any product-thieving rivals or commend new inventors submitting a new product idea to him. His inspiring image is also featured on numerous Mann Co. catalogs and promotional materials. He is known (and feared) for his belief in handling customer service issues personally, with his official policy being: \"If you aren't 100% satisfied with our product line, you can take it up with me!\"",

Many exhibit their special powers by bringing demise to the people around them (Painis Cupcake and Vagineer are infamous because of this). However, some TF2 Monsters will only attack if provoked or directly confronted (for example, Weaselcake), and others are actually rather friendly and well-mannered (such as Polite Spy or Intelligent Heavy).\nInteractions between the TF2 Freaks themselves are at least as varied. Some are actually minions of another (Snyphurr is a well-known example), others hold an intense rivalry between each other (like Sewer Medic and Heavydile, both semiaquatic and highly territorial), but some are also genuine friends, always lending a hand when necessary (for example, Ninjineer and Heavy Sumo Guy, inseparable friends).\nThey can be found on literally everywhere, and divided into 3 types, Friendly, Neutral and Hostile.

The herd may consist of all REDs, all BLUs, or a combination of both species. Studies show that these migrations happen regularly throughout the year, and are easy to find if you know where to look. The migration can be for various reasons. During warm summer months, they may migrate for food and water. When it is the start of spring, they gather to breed. They take the appearance of Spy with a crab head and pincers.\nLatin Name: Hafrolofty\nAt the time of its discovery, it was found that these Freaks were critically endangered. Overhunting by ignorant folks, had drastically brought the population down to almost a few dozen. The Spycrab was on the verge of extinction. However, once it was learned they were endangered, many people stood up for the Spycrab. Conservation groups were founded, and reserves were built to protect the Spycrab from illegal hunting while they tried to breed them back to a healthy population.

In fact, sometimes their appendages they use for healing/ubers flash with lights they have scrounged from garbage bins and power with the energy in their body.

The Explosive Soldier Bird (ESB) is known to rocket jump all over the place, as this is the most efficient way for it to travel. While rocket-jumping is a very risky practice, the ESB has special pads on its feet that absorb the explosive force of its barrage of rockets. By combining these pads with an almost unlimited supply of rockets, the ESB can travel from Point A to Point B in a matter of minutes. However, these Freaks are not born with such skills; the ability is learned from parent to offspring, generation after generation.\nWhen attacked, the ESB overloads its rockets, causing it to go into an explosive frenzy. This frenzy drives would-be attackers away, but often at the cost of the ESB's life. This kamikaze action may seem inefficient, but one ESB's sacrifice can let the others in the flock escape. However, this method of survival almost caused its downfall, as illegal hunting for the birds' foot pads unfortunately meant many more attacks of flocks, leading to more overloading individuals. This caused mass suicide in some cases, bringing the population down dramatically. Fortunately for the Explosive Soldier Bird, efforts from conservationists proved to be very helpful in bringing the ESB back to the world. As repopulation continues, so do studies on the creature. We hope to learn more very soon.",

The Sniperdile's tough, scaly skin provides a great defense from enemy attack, and its jagged teeth give it a deadly bite. All in all, it is a well-designed predator that can be quite the spectacle to see on the hunt. While a Sniperdile is on land, it is slow and sluggish, forced to crawl on its short legs. However, in the water, this reptile is much more mobile and can swim up to 20 miles per hour. This makes the Sniperdile more able to hunt in the water, pouncing from the murky depths to seize its prey.

While his powers are quite effective, he is been referred to a ninja wannabe on occasion.\nNinjineer is a very cunning warrior and martial artist, specializing in knocking foes out of consciousness. He is extremely nimble and fast, which allows him to avoid powerful attacks of slower opponents. On top of that, he tends to be a tricky opponent to face, given his agility, quick-thinking, and vast amount of tools and abilities, which he can utilize in many different ways.\nTo avoid being seen by hostile Freaks, Ninjie can disguise himself as an inanimate object, such as a rock, a box, a barrel, etc., but he is unable to disguise as another living entity, or move while disguised.",

His favorite pastimes include fighting, drinking, and battling with ferocious animals. In fact, most kids sleep with a teddy bear at night, but Saxton Hale sleeps with an actual bear that he tamed while in the Brazilian Jungles. His identifying features include a bold mustache, rippling muscles, a crocodile-tooth lined hat, and a patch of rotating chest hair shaped like Australia.\nSaxton is the most current male of the Hale family to take up the reins of Mann Co. since Zepheniah Mann left its ownership to loyal aide and tracker Barnabus Hale in his last will and testament. His boisterous presence is felt in all areas of the company, from the slogan \"We sell products and get in fights\" to Gorilla Wrestling Fridays – his attempt at employee morale building. He also fills out customer forms with tick-boxes to either intimidate any product-thieving rivals or commend new inventors submitting a new product idea to him. His inspiring image is also featured on numerous Mann Co. catalogs and promotional materials. He is known (and feared) for his belief in handling customer service issues personally, with his official policy being: \"If you aren't 100% satisfied with our product line, you can take it up with me!\"",

They are mutants, cyborgs, zombies, wizards, spirits, angels and demons, or ordinary humans in possession of some peculiar artefact, device, or even trait or skill.\nMany TF2 Freaks appear deceptively similar to bog standard mercenaries, but are generally avoided by the latter because of their often volatile and unpredictable nature. Many exhibit their special powers by bringing demise to the people around them (Painis Cupcake and Vagineer are infamous because of this). However, some TF2 Monsters will only attack if provoked or directly confronted (for example, Weaselcake), and others are actually rather friendly and well-mannered (such as Polite Spy or Intelligent Heavy).\nInteractions between the TF2 Freaks themselves are at least as varied. Some are actually minions of another (Snyphurr is a well-known example), others hold an intense rivalry between each other (like Sewer Medic and Heavydile, both semiaquatic and highly territorial), but some are also genuine friends, always lending a hand when necessary (for example, Ninjineer and Heavy Sumo Guy, inseparable friends).\nThey can be found on literally everywhere, and divided into 3 types, Friendly, Neutral and Hostile. Invasive to Ulhara. Though a lot of Friendly Freaks, like Demopan, managed to successfully assimilating to the native population.",

(Note: Grease monkey is a nickname, the true name is Simia Constructum)\nThe Grease Monkey lives mostly in forested areas, such as woodlands But some also live the grassy areas such as Swiftwater. They jump around constantly and break things whenever they want, making them a bad choice for domestication. The alpha, as a way to show dominance, theorized by Black Mesa specialist, Dr Coomer, hunts for a skull on the ground and wears it as a way to share this thought of dominance.\nThese apes are known for the ability to climb great heights, so thus they evolved to love fruit that grow on trees to aid survival. These simians have also been observed to build Sentries, Dispensers and Teleporters, like the other species of the genus Aedificare.\nThe behaviour of the Common Grease Monkey is deceptively simple-minded; Each monkey will attempt to reach the highest or most inaccessible area in his/her location and construct a nest. It will then guard this nest aggressively, chasing down all who intrude upon it, often until either party is killed. All Grease Monkeys are intelligent, and one underestimates them at their own peril. They look like a mix of Engineer and a monkey.",

Evolved from the common Decipio (Spy), the Spycrab is a harmless species that can be found on almost every continent (they can be on any map). The Spycrab has short (crouched) legs, and holds its claws high above its head as it walks to wherever its little heart desires. The Spycrab is virtually harmless, and would never attack anything, even if provoked. No one knows where these things plan to go, as they just seem to wander all over the place. Even the Spycrabs themselves seem to have trouble knowing which way they need to go.\nEvery now and then, a large herd of Spycrabs gathers to migrate. The herd may consist of all REDs, all BLUs, or a combination of both species. Studies show that these migrations happen regularly throughout the year, and are easy to find if you know where to look. The migration can be for various reasons. During warm summer months, they may migrate for food and water. When it is the start of spring, they gather to breed. They take the appearance of Spy with a crab head and pincers.\nLatin Name: Hafrolofty\nAt the time of its discovery, it was found that these Freaks were critically endangered. Overhunting by ignorant folks, had drastically brought the population down to almost a few dozen. The Spycrab was on the verge of extinction. However, once it was learned they were endangered, many people stood up for the Spycrab. Conservation groups were founded, and reserves were built to protect the Spycrab from illegal hunting while they tried to breed them back to a healthy population. Over the last few years, the Spycrab population slowly recovered until they were ready to be sent back into the wild.",

Meembirds mate for life.\nAfterwards, they will begin building a nest, usually in a cave away from other Meembirds, as a male in his hormonal rage will not hesitate to kill and eat chicks and eggs.

The males are the only ones that go to the surface, and that is only to collect shiny trinkets to show off to potential mates. They are not particularly brave, their only instinct being to run, not fight, but they are not very fast; their legs seem to be in a permanent crouching postition. They looked like Medic with the head of a mole.\nTunnel Medic is extremely docile, and because of that and it's slowness, is thought to be quite dumb. However, it is actually quite smart. As they often generate excess energy from all the special moss they eat, their bodies convert that energy into healing beams and invulnerability, which they spring at the most opportune time, like when they are attacked, hence showing they are not as thick as one might think.\nThey are often helpful to Heavy-based creatures, so much that any Heavy creature - even Heavydiles - will leave them alone and protect them, even from creatures they'd usually get along with.\nLike magpies, they do indeed love shiny things, adorning themselves with anything gold and shiny. In fact, sometimes their appendages they use for healing/ubers flash with lights they have scrounged from garbage bins and power with the energy in their body. The more shiny they are, the higher standing they have in their colony, and the more likely they are to attract mates.",

The Explosive Soldier Bird (ESB) is known to rocket jump all over the place, as this is the most efficient way for it to travel. While rocket-jumping is a very risky practice, the ESB has special pads on its feet that absorb the explosive force of its barrage of rockets. By combining these pads with an almost unlimited supply of rockets, the ESB can travel from Point A to Point B in a matter of minutes. However, these Freaks are not born with such skills; the ability is learned from parent to offspring, generation after generation.\nWhen attacked, the ESB overloads its rockets, causing it to go into an explosive frenzy. This frenzy drives would-be attackers away, but often at the cost of the ESB's life. This kamikaze action may seem inefficient, but one ESB's sacrifice can let the others in the flock escape. However, this method of survival almost caused its downfall, as illegal hunting for the birds' foot pads unfortunately meant many more attacks of flocks, leading to more overloading individuals. This caused mass suicide in some cases, bringing the population down dramatically. Fortunately for the Explosive Soldier Bird, efforts from conservationists proved to be very helpful in bringing the ESB back to the world. As repopulation continues, so do studies on the creature. We hope to learn more very soon.",

Wanderers, or Rovers, as they’re known by the natives, are made up of the people from Earth that have entered Ulhara as they have been drawn in to its strange, unnatural wonders and partake in a leisurely pastime in an attempt to get away from their usual chores of their lives, all without joining another group nor working with any organization, in other word, they’re unaffiliated with anyone. They come from all walks of life and their goals completely differ from one another: some came to Ulhara to get rich, others came for the thrill and more came over to start a new life. One thing they have in common is that they disapprove of anyone who cheats on their deals and attack them without a good reason. Usually travel in groups or solo without dedicated outposts.

They will ask people if they want some fish, either as a pet or food. They mostly sell salmon, Scoot Sharks (another Scout Freak species), gold fish, shrimp, plankton, and other aquatic species. They can put them in a bowl for pets, deep fry, bake, grill, and boil fish for costumers. After they're out of fish or they haven't gotten a customer in a long time, they dive into the ocean and spend their money in underwater casinos that they formed in native Mermaids and Seafolk settlements. They're usually friendly, unless provoked. Aside from gambling, hunting, fishing, and selling, they may also go on adventures to find treasures for either themselves or banks. They’re one of the Freak species that was assimilated to the native Ulharan cultures.",
