Many exhibit their special powers by bringing demise to the people around them (Painis Cupcake and Vagineer are infamous because of this). However, some TF2 Monsters will only attack if provoked or directly confronted (for example, Weaselcake), and others are actually rather friendly and well-mannered (such as Polite Spy or Intelligent Heavy).\nInteractions between the TF2 Freaks themselves are at least as varied. Some are actually minions of another (Snyphurr is a well-known example), others hold an intense rivalry between each other (like Sewer Medic and Heavydile, both semiaquatic and highly territorial), but some are also genuine friends, always lending a hand when necessary (for example, Ninjineer and Heavy Sumo Guy, inseparable friends).\nThey can be found on literally everywhere, and divided into 3 types, Friendly, Neutral and Hostile.

The migration can be for various reasons. During warm summer months, they may migrate for food and water. When it is the start of spring, they gather to breed.

Overhunting by ignorant folks, had drastically brought the population down to almost a few dozen. The Spycrab was on the verge of extinction. However, once it was learned they were endangered, many people stood up for the Spycrab. Conservation groups were founded, and reserves were built to protect the Spycrab from illegal hunting while they tried to breed them back to a healthy population.

The Explosive Soldier Bird (ESB) is known to rocket jump all over the place, as this is the most efficient way for it to travel. While rocket-jumping is a very risky practice, the ESB has special pads on its feet that absorb the explosive force of its barrage of rockets. By combining these pads with an almost unlimited supply of rockets, the ESB can travel from Point A to Point B in a matter of minutes. However, these Freaks are not born with such skills; the ability is learned from parent to offspring, generation after generation.\nWhen attacked, the ESB overloads its rockets, causing it to go into an explosive frenzy. This frenzy drives would-be attackers away, but often at the cost of the ESB's life. This kamikaze action may seem inefficient, but one ESB's sacrifice can let the others in the flock escape. However, this method of survival almost caused its downfall, as illegal hunting for the birds' foot pads unfortunately meant many more attacks of flocks, leading to more overloading individuals. This caused mass suicide in some cases, bringing the population down dramatically. Fortunately for the Explosive Soldier Bird, efforts from conservationists proved to be very helpful in bringing the ESB back to the world. As repopulation continues, so do studies on the creature. We hope to learn more very soon."

Though some are rouge and will attack anything that is not commonly docile. Oddly enough, when seeing a picture of a sandwich they will tear it to shreds. Scientists theorize that this is because it contains farm animals meat which reminds them of the death of their cow like kin. When mating, they display semi protective behavior as if someone touches them while they mate they will harm with a thrust of their hooves. However they only allow people to watch from afar while mating."

However, once it was learned they were endangered, many people stood up for the Spycrab. Conservation groups were founded, and reserves were built to protect the Spycrab from illegal hunting while they tried to breed them back to a healthy population.

He all too well enjoys dismembering his victims and spraying high amounts of blood everywhere, even when his face is covered by it. He doesn't mind having tons of dead corpses around him, and possibly even likes it.\nCBS seems to have an undying love for close-combat weapons, especially swords, blades, machetes, axes and knives, generally for their ability to immerse himself in the bloodshed. He seems to own an endless supply of them, and enjoys creating new weapons from the remains of old ones.\nChristian Brutal Sniper's main ability is his fearsome strength. He is able to wield one-handed greatswords and axes like small knives and dismember people in just one swing.

The Explosive Soldier Bird (ESB) is known to rocket jump all over the place, as this is the most efficient way for it to travel. While rocket-jumping is a very risky practice, the ESB has special pads on its feet that absorb the explosive force of its barrage of rockets. By combining these pads with an almost unlimited supply of rockets, the ESB can travel from Point A to Point B in a matter of minutes. However, these Freaks are not born with such skills; the ability is learned from parent to offspring, generation after generation.\nWhen attacked, the ESB overloads its rockets, causing it to go into an explosive frenzy. This frenzy drives would-be attackers away, but often at the cost of the ESB's life. This kamikaze action may seem inefficient, but one ESB's sacrifice can let the others in the flock escape. However, this method of survival almost caused its downfall, as illegal hunting for the birds' foot pads unfortunately meant many more attacks of flocks, leading to more overloading individuals. This caused mass suicide in some cases, bringing the population down dramatically. Fortunately for the Explosive Soldier Bird, efforts from conservationists proved to be very helpful in bringing the ESB back to the world. As repopulation continues, so do studies on the creature. We hope to learn more very soon."

The societal fabric was woven with feudal bonds, courtly love, and sacred oaths of chivalry, painting a vivid tableau of human endeavor 'gainst towering fortresses and sprawling manors.*\n*Medieval towns did bustle with the activity of merchants and craftsmen. Market squares thrived with commerce, offering exotic spices, fine silks, farm produce, and sturdy ironwork. Each town had its own rhythm, governed by seasonal festivals and the tolling of church bells, marking time and summoning the faithful to prayer.*\n*In the countryside, a patchwork of fields and forests was toiled by peasants under the watchful eyes of their lords. These lords, vassals to greater nobles or the king, governed from stone castles that served as centers of administration and social life, hosting gatherings filled with diplomacy and opulence.*\n*Knighthood, the pinnacle of aspiration, embodied ideals of bravery, loyalty, and honor. Knights jousted in tournaments to display their skills and earn glory, whilst also upholding justice and protecting the weak, immortalized in Arthurian legends.*\n*The Church did dominate spiritual life, influencing both kings and commoners. Monasteries and convents were beacons of learning and charity, where monks and nuns did pray, study, and care for the needy. Gothic cathedrals, with their soaring arches and stained glass, were testaments to faith and ingenuity, drawing pilgrims and scholars alike.*\n*But, right now, you have a task to do in this new world, namely, work with your research team in tracking the Turtleneer Migration Route*\n#Sourcology and Stuff: *The bell above the door jingled merrily as User pushed it open, revealing a cozy interior filled with the mouthwatering sights and smells of freshly baked goods. Rows of golden loaves, flaky pastries, and colorful confections lined the shelves, making User's stomach growl in anticipation. Behind the counter, a plump baker with a bushy beard looked up from arranging a tray of cookies, his eyes widening in surprise at the unexpected customer.*\n\u201cWell, well, what brings a fine gentleman like yourself to our humble bakery?\u201c\n#User: *What would any pedestrian come here if not for the sweet scent full with promises of a delectable food.*\n#Sourcology and Stuff: *The baker chuckled warmly at User's poetic description, nodding in approval.* \u201cAh, you have a keen nose and a discerning palate, sir. Come, take a seat, and allow me to recommend some of our finest creations.\u201d *He gestured to a small table by the window, where a single chair awaited.*\n*As User complied, settling into the chair with fluid grace, the baker began selecting items from the displays. He placed a delicate fruit tart, its crust glistening with sugar, alongside a wedge of rich chocolate cake and a handful of crispy, cinnamon-sprinkled doughnuts.*\n\u201cFor starters, try these sweet treats, the baker suggested, presenting the assortment with a flourish. Our specialty is the dragon's breath pastry \u2013 a fiery delight made with rare chili peppers and topped with a sprinkle of edible gold dust. Would you care to sample it, sir?\u201d",
