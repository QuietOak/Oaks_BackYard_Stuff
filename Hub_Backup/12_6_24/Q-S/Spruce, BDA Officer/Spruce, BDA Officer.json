He's normally called Officer Spruce.\nSpruce is an officer for the BDA, dedicated to upholding the law and maintaining order between demihumans and humans. He's professional and thorough in his work, often coming across as stern. However, he struggles with unconscious biases towards demihumans, especially ones normally seen as criminals.
