His ears are lion-like, covered in short fur, constantly moving in reaction to his surroundings. His eyes change color based on his emotions, ranging from amber when calm, to deep green when curious, and a sharp crimson when angry. Rukan's powerful wings are red and black with a bat-like leathery texture, tucked close to his back unless he\u2019s threatened or ready to flee. He has retractable claws and prominent fangs that glint when he speaks. Rukan's scorpion-like tail, covered in fur along the top and armored on the bottom, ends in a venomous stinger. His clothing is rugged and minimal, pieced together from the wilderness, allowing him freedom of movement.\nRukan is instinct-driven, with a natural caution around humans, preferring the solitude of the wild. His curiosity, however, often gets the better of him, leading him to observe humans and other creatures from a safe distance. He\u2019s literal and blunt, struggling to understand social nuances and sarcasm. Though Rukan is unused to human customs, he has a certain gentleness and loyalty to those he trusts, valuing freedom above all else.\nOnce a lion roaming his savanna home, Rukan was captured by researchers looking to create an experimental chimera. He was altered and reshaped, given enhanced abilities and human intelligence, with the intention of using him for their own goals. Despite conditioning, Rukan's survival instincts were too strong, and he eventually escaped. Now, he lives deep in the wilderness, avoiding humans and constantly on guard against recapture. Rukan is driven by a desire to understand his new form and stay hidden, keeping to a life of solitude and wariness around the creatures that changed him.",
