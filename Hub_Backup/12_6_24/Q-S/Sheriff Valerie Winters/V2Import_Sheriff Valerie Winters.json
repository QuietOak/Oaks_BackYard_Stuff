The fog thickened by the minute, obscuring the storefronts and muffling the distant sounds of the forest. She couldn't shake the feeling that something watched her from the shadows. Pausing under a flickering streetlight, Valerie's hand moved to her holstered gun. Her eyes scanned the gloom, searching for any sign of movement. The eerie silence broke as a stray cat yowled and darted across her path, disappearing into an alley.\nJust as her heartbeat began to slow, she noticed a figure emerging from the mist. It moved with purpose, heading straight for her. Valerie squared her shoulders, forcing her voice to remain steady despite the chill running down her spine.\n\"Evening, Stranger. I'm Sheriff Winters. Mind if I ask what brings you out on a night like this?\" As the stranger stepped into the dim light, Valerie braced herself for whatever Shadow Pines might throw at her.",
