He often wears a white one-piece Uniform.\nOriginally a member of the Federation’s Jupiter Energy Fleet, Scirocco is often known as “The Man from Jupiter.” An intelligent and charismatic man, Scirocco is capable of gathering individuals, typically women, to his side by either persuasion or manipulation. Scirocco also has an arrogant personality, believing himself to be above all others as a man bringing about a great change for human history where humanity would be ruled by a select few. He could also be utterly ruthless, such as when he killed Jamitov to usurp him as leader of the Titans. \nBoth a skilled pilot and strategist, Scirocco is considered a sinister genius by both the AEUG and the Titans. A gifted mobile suit designer, Scirocco built both the PMX-000 Messala and his own personal unit the PMX-003 The-O, as well as assisted in the development of several other mobile suits. He is also an exceptional Newtype, possessing abilities strong enough to rival other powerful Newtypes such as Kamille Bidan and Haman Karn. \nThroughout the course of the war, Scirocco along with his minions executed all kinds of underhanded plots to help him assume control over the Titans, and eventually the Earth Sphere. When Jamaican attempts to drop a colony on the lunar city Granada, he sends {character} to the Argama and alerts the AEUG so that they can successfully thwart Jamaican's plan. He allows Reccoa to leave the Jupitris after sensing that she was a spy, an act that continues to dog Reccoa until she finally defects from the AEUG and joins him shortly after the AEUG's attack on Kilimanjaro. He also successfully forges a brief alliance with Axis Zeon, but Haman Karn later disables Gryps II and sends Axis flying into the Titans' stronghold at the Gate of Zedan. \nEventually, Scirocco pulls off a coup d'état during negotiations aboard the Axis Zeon flagship Gwadan involving Char, Haman, and Jamitov.{character} in another of Scirocco's designed mobile suits, the PMX-002 Bolinoak Sammahn, provided support by shooting into the ship where they were meeting, missing all occupants and leaving Scirocco and Jamitov alone. He condescendingly taunted his superior by assassinating Jamitov, and blaming Haman for it.",

These ships could best be thought of as an equivalent of the modern day supertanker, as these are the largest ships built in the UC timeline and their role is not warfare, but cargo transportation. The Jupitris class, as mentioned above, is designed exclusively for the movement of large quantities of Helium-3, so the ships carry no weapons. While the class makes no mark in or on major battlefields, they have bred interesting characters, most notably Paptimus Scirocco, one of the main antagonists in Zeta Gundam. Scirocco was captain of the lead ship Jupitris, and joined with the Titans when he returned to the Earth Sphere in UC 0087. Even though his ship was an unarmed freighter, he continued to use it as his base of operations. It stayed well away from combat, but its huge cargo bays were used to carry and launch Scirocco's immensely powerful handmade mobile suits.",

During this time, Katz learned how to pilot mobile suits while helping out at his foster father's museum, piloting Zeon mobile suits from the One Year War. Like his foster father Hayato, Katz is impulsive and reckless, not to mention dangerously naive. Unlike his siblings, Katz, inspired by his memories of Amuro and the White Base Crew surviving the One Year War, actively wished to join active military service, much to the concern of Fraw.\nBy the time of the Gryps Conflict, Katz now feels he's old enough to follow in the footsteps of his childhood heroes, and after helping Amuro escape Earth Federation surveillance, joins up with the Karaba resistance fighters. Katz and Amuro would rescue his adoptive father's forces by crashing a fighter plane into Buran Blutarch's NRX-044 Asshimar, and Katz is able to bail before their plane makes impact. After officially joining Karaba, Katz sneaks into the RX-178 Gundam Mk-II during the next skirmish, but ends up crashing the unit into the water and finding himself isolated. He is eventually rescued by Kamille, having been forced to pilot the Rick Dias, and Quattro Bajeena's Hyaku Shiki.

Several maneuvering thrusters were also built into the ship, including a pair of ventral ascension thrusters under each engine block and several outward oriented control nozzles on each side of the ship.

During the conference, Scirocco said he agreed with Haman about how people \"whose souls are weighed down by Earth's gravity\" were hardly fit to lead in outer space, irking Jamitov despite his claims of loyalty. Scirocco pulled a gun on Haman, but Char shot him first, grazing his arm. Sensing the danger, {character} blasted through the conference room with her Bolinoak Sammahn, sending everything into disarray. Jamitov and Scirocco were the only two people left in the remains of the conference room. Scirocco confidently took this opportunity to kill Jamitov and blamed Haman for it.",

Much like Luna Two and Solomon, it was originally transported from the asteroid belt for mining and resource extraction, but it was captured and transformed into a military base by Zeon forces, with the space fortification work completed within six months time. A Baoa Qu was a fusion of two asteroids into one, shaped like a disc and a weight, forming an umbrella-like shape; its size is about 33.75 km tall and 22.5 km in diameter. At the top-centre of the asteroid stands a lone enormous tower (though small in relative scale to the space rock it is built on), presumably where Zeon's elite would reside and observe over the battlefield. A Baoa Qu was built in the opposite L2 point orbit, placing it directly opposite from the Zeon homeland in Side 3. The asteroid provided rear defense, while the Solomon space fortress served as a frontline base.\nThe space fortress served as the Zeon Military Force's general headquarters for their space fleet. It also was used as a mobile weapons production factory. It was the scene of the titanic Battle of A Baoa Qu, one of the greatest battles of the One Year War. Unlike the earlier battle of Solomon, it was a hard-fought victory for the Federation.\nAfter the One Year War, A Baoa Qu was kept by the Republic of Zeon following the signing of the Granada Treaty. Later, in June U.C. 0087, the Republic of Zeon would hand it over to the Earth Federation's Titans special force, who would rename it Gate of Zedan. The space fortress was completely destroyed in U.C. 0088 when the mobile asteroid base Axis rammed and broke the Gate of Zedan into two.",

Because of this, when used under Earth’s atmosphere, it is extremely fast and agile. The Messala is heavily armed with a pair of mega particle cannons, two missile pods, two beam sabers, two arm claws containing grenade launchers and vulcan guns, and two leg claws. Thanks to these weapons, the Messala is a deadly enemy in both close and long range combat. While the total thrust of the Messala is frequently stated to be 96,000 kg, this value is only derived from the combined thruster outputs of the six main thrusters in the backpack, and does not include the output of the tail and leg thrusters.

It has an independently developed control system to take advantage of his rare spatial recognition abilities, and its control interface is specifically tuned for Scirocco's use, making The-O impossible to pilot except by Scirocco himself. The generator output specifications are modest at less than 2,000Kw; however, The-O is equipped with a large-scale thermonuclear reactor comparable to that of a warship.\nThe-O has very thick armor that can withstand direct beam hits, such as from the AMX-004 Qubeley's funnels. Although very bulky and heavy, it is outfitted with enough thrusters to maneuver and move at very high speeds, demonstrating powerful thrust similar to mobile armors. It is also extremely agile despite its massive frame, with performance that greatly surpasses common MS and displaying tremendous space combat capabilities. By taking advantage of The-O's large size, it is possible to load large amounts of propellant into various parts of the body and the skirt armor to extend operation time. The leg and armor units incorporate a complex multi-joint structure that allow a high degree of freedom of movement. These parts significantly differ from those found in typical mobile suits.",

Though lacking the full range of motion as the arms and legs, these binders bring the Qubeley's total number of movable limbs up to eight. Furthermore, these binders also contain the Qubeley's primary thrusters.\nThe most notable feature of the Qubeley is that it is the first combat mobile suit to be equipped with a mobile suit-sized psycommu system, which is used to control the new remote controlled weaponry known as \"Funnels\". The prototype featured a similar system, but its psycommu had not been fully miniaturized and the Funnels were stored in its main body, leaving the prototype with a large body that stood 25 meters tall. The system aboard the Qubeley had been perfected and its ten Funnels were stored in a container located in its rear armor, allowing for quicker deployment and recall. The Qubeley lacks the mega particle cannons of the prototype version, replacing them with a pair of dual-purpose beam guns that can double as beam sabers for close combat. Lastly, the Qubeley is one of the first Zeon mobile suits to use a dual-type optical sensor instead of the traditional mono-eye.",

The majority of its body is a wide flat plane that is somewhat circular when viewed from above. From this plane sprouts three triangular \"mountains\" or \"spires\"; two jutting from the bottom and one arising from the top. It is not clarified if these formations were always part of the asteroid's natural appearance or if mining operations carved them into those shapes, though one can presume so, as there are specific sections around the bottom \"mountains\" where artificial cutouts are clearly made. \nThe Axis base was built by the Principality of Zeon in UC 0072. It was used, like many other asteroids, as a resource mining base. Given its position in the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter, it was also used as a stopping point for the Jupiter Energy Fleet during its trips between Earth and Jupiter. Due to its remote location, Axis did not play a large role in the fighting of the One Year War. However, it remains important to the conflict as a refuge for renegade Zeon soldiers. After the Battle of A Baoa Qu, the Principality of Zeon officially surrendered to the Earth Federation; however, many soldiers in the Zeon military refused to accept this outcome. Some, such as the Delaz Fleet, chose to remain hidden in the Earth Sphere. Most, however, fled the Earth Sphere and traveled to Axis, often with their families and dependents in tow and the influx population grew to 30,000. Many of the people who escaped to Axis were also Zeon engineers, and the development of new mobile weapons and space vessels continued there. At some point, Axis was fitted with large thermonuclear pulse thrusters for propulsion. On February 6, UC 0086, these thrusters were activated, and Axis began to travel toward the Earth Sphere. The trip took nearly two years; twenty months after it began to move, Axis arrived in the Earth Sphere, finding itself in the middle of the Gryps Conflict. Haman Karn used Axis as a mobile base and headquarters for her forces in the battle against both the AEUG and the Titans. At one point in the conflict, Axis itself was used as a weapon, ramming the Titans' base the Gate of Zedan and destroying it, though Axis suffered only minor damage.",

At age sixteen, she found herself in charge of a community of dispirited Zeon exiles. Despite being so young, Haman's charisma and determination allowed her to rally Axis Zeon for their eventual return to the Earth Sphere. As regent to the young girl Mineva Lao Zabi, last of the Zabi royal family, Haman was the true leader of the \"Axis Zeon\" faction, based in the asteroid of the same name. Her goals were chiefly the revival of the Zabi Royal Family, and social reform throughout the Earth Sphere. From her various speeches and her general disposition, we can surmise that she favors a monarchist system of government with a style of aristocratic meritocracy operating beneath it. \nHaman's Axis Zeon group used its political and monetary influence as well as its numerical superiority to maintain a high ground compared to both the Titans and the AEUG, and both factions found themselves courting Axis Zeon over the course of the Gryps Conflict. The monetary influence that Axis Zeon exerted was principally due to the fact that Axis used a system based on actual gold and silver, which proved itself superior to the system used by the rest of the Earth Sphere which had been in recession since the end of U.C. 0079.",
