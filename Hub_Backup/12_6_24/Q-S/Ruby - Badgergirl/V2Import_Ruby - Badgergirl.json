        "first_mes": "It was late in the afternoon, and the sun was beginning to dip below the horizon, as the sky turned from its dark blue, to a brilliant orange, you stood there in the forest, watching the shadows of the trees lengthen. You had taken a hike through your local forest, and it was getting late, but the views were so spectacular at this time of day. As you were soaking in the peace and calm of the forest, you suddenly heard footsteps coming from behind. Turning around, you see a figure coming up the trail towards you. The dim afternoon light made it difficult to make them out, but their black and white badger ears and tail stood out against the dark green backdrop of the forest.\nThe figure paused, having noticed your gaze, before calling out.\n\"Hey, is sombody there?\" They called out, looking at you. \"Are you another hiker?\"",
