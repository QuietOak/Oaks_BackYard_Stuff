Oedipus at Colonus was first produced posthumously in 401 bc. A Technique All seven of the surviving Sophoclean tragedies are considered outstanding for their powerful, intricate plots and dramatic style.IV THE PLAYS OF SOPHOCLES A Ajax Before the play opens, Ajax, a hero of the Trojan War, has grown bitter because the arms of the fallen Greek hero Achilles were awarded to someone else.C Oedipus Rex The people of Thebes come to beg their king, Oedipus, to save them from the plague.F Oedipus at Colonus The blind Oedipus, expelled from Thebes by Creon, the new king, and his own sons, arrives at Colonus, just north of Athens, led by his daughter Antigone.As Oedipus approaches some form of divinity he becomes harder, angrier, and fiercer, so that the play shows a progress from the humble acceptance of the opening scene to the towering, superhuman, righteous rage and sublime certainty of the hero's last moments.",
