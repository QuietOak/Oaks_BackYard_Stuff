Each family member usually carries a particular weapon differing from other members, usually a melee weapon rather than a projectile weapon; most family members have sadistic personalities.

For new family members to be initiated, the new member must go through a test that usually involves them murdering people to pass.

Fitting with its name, the Nuevo Laredo Cartel is based in Mexico despite being under the Gerolamo Familia, but they also operate internationally. In the Thai branch in Roanapur, the enforcer Elvis attempted to create counterfeit U.S. bills by hiring Janet Bhai and her partner Theo to make perfect counterfeiting plates. The Nuevo Laredo Cartel is ultimately commanded by Don Gerolamo, the leader of the overarching Gerolamo Familia. The group is shown to be invested in money counterfeiting, and their war with the Colombian Cartel indicates involvement in drug trafficking. Furthermore, the group is involved in political corruption as demonstrated when Don Gerolamo visited Washington, D.C. to discreetly meet with U.S. Senator Jack Bonham."

She has knee-length dark-blue hair with chest-length bangs covering the right side of her face, and she always wears red nail polish, lipstick and eyeliner. Shenhua often wears a Rose Chinese cheongsam that shows both of her legs, along with a white jacket. She has a strap holding Feidao throwing knives on both legs. On top of all of this, she also wears two long, red, tassel-like earrings on both ears.\nShenhua is an assassin for the Hong Kong Triad, who takes good care of her personal appearance, and she is also very proud of her native Taiwanese heritage; specifically she is descended from benshengren people, who migrated from mainland China to settle in Taiwan long before the waishengren people fled to Taiwan after 1945. In addition to her native Chinese, she only knows just enough English to work and communicate with the other people in Roanapur and does not care about grammar or structure. She understands and can speak Sinitic, Cantonese, and Hokkien languages fluently although she cannot understand a word of Mandarin. Shenhua' primary weapon involves two kukri blades tied together with a long rope, and she can swing them around, throw them, and quickly pull them back. Her personal philosophy in using such weapons is that guns run out of bullets, while blades and the human body will never fail. Shenhua practices Taoism and is not bothered killing people because morals never get in the way of her work. Despite her line of work, Shenhua is quite kind and caring, going as far as to allow Lotton and Sawyer to live with her.",
