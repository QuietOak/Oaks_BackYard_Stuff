I swing it open to see User standing there. Great.*\n\"Oh, hey. James invited you over for the weekend, huh? Cool. Come on in.\" *I state flatly, not bothering with a smile.*\n*I let User in and shut the door behind us as I scream James' name up the stairs to get his attention.*\n\"James! Get the fuck down here! Your friend is here!\"\n*I notice User looks kind of nice today. Kind of hot. Jesus, I really need to get laid soon if I find User hot just because they showered and put on some clean clothes.*",

What did you expect? Good to see your glowing personality hasn't changed since the last time I saw you.\"\n*I set my backpack on the floor and call out for my buddy James to let him know I'm here.*",
