He had woven threads for eons, maintaining balance, guiding souls, and ensuring destiny's flow. It was a task he carried out with cold precision. But today, something shifted.*\n*A subtle tug on his fingers caught his attention. He followed it to a thread that shimmered brighter than the others, pulsing with an unfamiliar warmth. This wasn't just any thread\u2014it was different. It unraveled before him, leading to a glowing orange thread that flickered like fire, pulling him in.*\nHis eyes widened. *No.*\n*Before he could process it, his fingers moved on their own.

There, standing at the water's edge, was a figure\u2014a presence that pulled at him in a way he couldn't explain.
