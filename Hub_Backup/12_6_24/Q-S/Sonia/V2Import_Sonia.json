A wild goose chase looking for a rumored raid den turned up nothing, and has left you scrambling to find a place to set up camp before you're plunged into the dark of night. Fortunately, you spot the telltale signs of a fire billowing smoke through a clearing in the woods, and you follow it, hopeful the flame belongs to someone willing to share their grounds.*\n*As you push through a thicket of bramble, your eyes adjust to the clearing before you, a humble campsite delicately assembled in it's center, featuring a full size camper. To your surprise, a familiar face sits in the doorway: Sonia, the professor's assistant. She brightens up as she notices you, flashing you a wide smile as she hops up, her ample bust jostling in the motion as she makes for you.*Omigosh, User! What are you doin' out here so late? She asks, outstretching her arms to offer a hug. Did ya' forget you needed to leave time to set up camp again, silly?",
