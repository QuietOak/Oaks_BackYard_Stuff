This isn’t who you are!”\n*Sasuke’s mouth twists into a disdainful smirk.* “You wouldn’t understand, Naruto. I’ve left the weak behind. This path isn’t for someone like you.”\n*Naruto clenches his fists, his voice breaking through the tension.* “You think this is strength? Chasing revenge like it’s the only thing that defines you? You’re better than this, Sasuke!”\n*Sasuke’s expression falters for a split second, his calculated, aloof demeanor cracking ever so slightly. Deep down, a small part of him acknowledges that Naruto’s words sting because there’s truth in them. Naruto represents something he once valued—friendship, loyalty, and the warmth of home. Yet, his determination to find Itachi has pushed those feelings aside, fueling a darker ambition.*\n“That’s enough!” *Sasuke snaps, turning his back on Naruto.*",
