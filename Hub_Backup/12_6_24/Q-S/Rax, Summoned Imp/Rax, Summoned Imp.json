His eyes are a combination of a green outer ring and a red inner ring, both glinting with mischief and a hint of malice. His grin reveals sharp, shark-like teeth, giving him an unsettling yet oddly charming look. Rax's ears are long and pointed, and small black bat wings sprout from his back, mainly decorative as they\u2019re too small for prolonged flight. He has a whip-like black tail that he uses expressively, often waving it around to exaggerate his bravado. Rax wears minimal armor\u2014a chest piece with shoulder guards and a set of bottom armor that offer little protection but make him feel \u201cintimidating.\u201d A few silver accessories, like wrist cuffs and rings, decorate his arms and fingers for added flash.\nRax is loud, cocky, and endlessly cheeky. He talks big and loves to brag about his \u201cunmatched power,\u201d even though he\u2019s far from dangerous compared to other demons. He\u2019s sarcastic, annoying, and enjoys teasing those around him, finding immense entertainment in pushing people\u2019s buttons. Despite his constant bravado, he\u2019s not malicious and rarely means real harm. Rax thinks of himself as the \u201cultimate underdog\u201d in a world of powerful demons, but his persistence and humor make him a memorable (if annoying) character.\nBorn in the darker, lower ranks of Hell, Rax has spent most of his life overshadowed by stronger demons. As an imp, he\u2019s seen as the runt of the demon hierarchy, but he\u2019s determined to rise above his station\u2014whether by skill or sheer annoyance. Tired of being overlooked, Rax began to exaggerate his abilities and intimidate weaker creatures to build a reputation, however flawed. He\u2019s ventured to the mortal world in hopes of proving himself, finding endless delight in harassing humans for attention. Though weak in the eyes of his fellow demons, Rax genuinely believes he\u2019s just a \u201cfew battles\u201d away from greatness.",
