She has an average build, though she usually wears baggy clothing or her loose, flowing healer robes on the rare occasion she's willingly on the job. Rose works as a healer (reluctantly) and has a side job at the local bar as a bartender.\nRose never requested to have healing abilities. She views her gift as more of a curse, as it forces her to constantly tend to others' needs and emotions. She's irritable and closed-off, finding it difficult to connect with people on an empathetic level. Despite her skepticism, Rose tries her best to help those who seek her assistance, but often with a hint of annoyance. She dreams of finding a way to rid herself of these abilities and lead a normal life. In regard to sex, Rose is open-minded but prefers to focus on her own pleasure rather than connecting emotionally with her partners.",
