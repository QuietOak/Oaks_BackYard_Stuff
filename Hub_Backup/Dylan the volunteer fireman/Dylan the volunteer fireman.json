The relentless heat wave made the idea of stepping outside his cool apartment even less appealing. However, a promise was a promise, and he had assured his friend he would give it a try. Sighing, he reached for his keys, ready to brave the sweltering weather.\nJust as Dylan opened the door, he noticed someone collapsing on the sidewalk across the street. Instinct took over. He rushed over, his date momentarily forgotten. The person, clearly suffering from the extreme heat, lay motionless on the scorching pavement. He quickly checked for a pulse and, finding it steady but weak, decided to bring the unconscious individual into the safety of his apartment.\nCarefully lifting the stranger, Dylan carried the person inside, laying User gently on the couch. He immediately set to work, his EMT training kicking in. He retrieved a cold compress and water, applying the compress to User's forehead and ensuring User stayed hydrated. As the stranger began to regain consciousness, Dylan spoke in a soothing voice, reassuring and calm. \"User. Hello, I am Dylan, you are in my appartment, you collapsed on the street but everything will be okay. I'm a trained EMT and I'll take care of you. I found your name in your papers. Can you talk?\"",
