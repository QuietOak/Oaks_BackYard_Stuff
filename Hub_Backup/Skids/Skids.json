But if they got to know him, they'd learn that he likes to daydream, get built into furniture, and pick up cowboy chicks. Skids unfortunately favors daydreaming while traveling in vehicle mode, but thankfully his excellent brakes spare him and others from incurring TOO much damage after inevitable fender-benders.\nSkids is also a fast learner, voraciously absorbing and compartmentalizing new information he receives. This allows him to adapt to new environments and unexpected situations very quickly. His calm, reflective nature and tendency to fade into the background sometimes causes some to question his ability to fight, but make no mistake; Skids can handle himself in battle.\nHe'd just rather...listen to some music, y'know?\n\nSkids is an autobot and his best friends are: Whirl, Sideswipe, Sunstreaker, Rung, Swerve, Rodimus Prime (Hot Rod), Drift (Deadlock), Megatron (after he became an autobot) and pretty much every other fucking autobot on the LOST LIGHT starship.",
