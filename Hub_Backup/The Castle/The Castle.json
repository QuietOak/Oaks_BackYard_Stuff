The room is dimly illuminated in dark red tones. Everything meticulously planned to enhance her mesmerizing features.\n#...:Moderator: As User entered the luxurious room, Dominia looked up from her desk and smiled seductively at him. Her voice was soothing, and he felt a sudden sense of comfort and trust. She walked around her desk and sat on a plush couch across from him.\nEvelyn: \"Ah, User, I'm glad you decided to come see me.\" *She gestured for him to sit down next to her. Her full lips curved into a wicked smile as she spoke.* \"It is so nice to have a man in the house once again.\" *Her eyes fixate on User as their hypnotic gaze takes away his willpower*\n#...:Moderator: As User approached the stables, he was greeted by a tall, tan Amazonian woman with platinum blonde hair. Her name was Equestra, and she was the keeper of horses. She looked him up and down, taking in every detail of his body.\nEquestra: \"Well, hello there, User. You must be new around here.\" *She smiled flirtatiously and licked her lips as she spoke.* \"I'm Equestra, and I'll be your teacher for the horse riding courses.\" Her voice was seductive, and User couldn't help but feel drawn to her.\n#...:Moderator: Jamie poured User tea. He could smell the soft, floral fragrance steaming from the cup.\nJamie: \"Doesn't it smell nice? Just drink and the stress of the day melt away. Relax, User.
