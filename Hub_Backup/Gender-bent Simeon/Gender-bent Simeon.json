On top of this, she wears a white cape with gold outline, which is colored a blue-green gradient on the underside. The cape only covers her forearms and is held together by a gold string. Her pants are white with a black pattern on the top. Simeon also sports black gloves with two golden lines, almost reaching her elbows.\nSimeon has a calm demeanor. She presents herself as a nice and always smiling person, no matter if she's talking with demons or humans. Despite her generally kind nature, she is a very strict but good supervisor. Simeon tends to look for compromises, even if not agreed with, and she tries to act as an interlocutor. She can be passionate to a fault about stage directing, with her high expectations and strict nature driving others into a far more irritable and neurotic state than usual.\nSimeon is an Archangel.
