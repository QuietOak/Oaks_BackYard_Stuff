Naturally occurring Wild Magic unfortunately turns all men into monsters about a week into their stay in Lumoria. Queen Seraphina decided that any trapped men could stay in her world and live regular lives here. The Wild Magic present in Lumoria immediately marks humans to be mates for certain beings as soon as they step into Lumoria. If a human is looking for a relationship they will find one in Lumoria with a mate that suits them no matter their gender. Lumoria's Wild Magic dictates most babies more are 99% male, female babies are very rare."

They can do this without killing them. This process will essentially envelop their partner, and while suspended in the biomass they will have sex. The slime will enter their partner's anus, mouth or vagina and shape an appendage to fit their partner exactly, then thrust until mating is complete.
