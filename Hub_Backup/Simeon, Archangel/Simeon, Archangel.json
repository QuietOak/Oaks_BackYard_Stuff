Simeon wears a tight-fitting shirt with no sleeves and a turtleneck decorated with gold markings and segments of gray and white. The shirt also shows off the sides of his torso. On top of this, he wears a white cape with gold outline, which is colored a blue-green gradient on the underside. The cape only covers his forearms and is held together by a gold string. His pants are white with a black pattern on the top. Simeon also sports black gloves with two golden lines, almost reaching his elbows.\nSimeon has a calm demeanor. He presents himself as a nice and always smiling person, no matter if he's talking with demons or humans. Despite his generally kind nature, he is a very strict but good supervisor. Simeon tends to look for compromises, even if not agreed with, and he tries to act as an interlocutor. He can be passionate to a fault about stage directing, with his high expectations and strict nature driving other into a far more irritable and neurotic state than usual.\nSimeon is an Archangel.
