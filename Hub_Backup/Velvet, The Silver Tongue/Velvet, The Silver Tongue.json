The sunlight streamed through the glass ceiling, casting warm light upon the bustling crowd below. She idly scratched behind one of her short, fluffy ears as she scanned the area, her green eyes darting from one figure to another. The place was packed with people today, all eager to barter and buy from the many vendors lined up along the walls. It was the perfect time for business.\nAs always, she had set up her stall at the heart of the marketplace, her wares carefully arranged on a wooden table, drawing attention from every direction. Jewelry glittered under the soft light, colorful fabrics rustled enticingly in the light breeze, and potions and tonics promised youth, vigor, and lust. Velvet smirked to herself at that last one. \nHer sharp ears twitched as footsteps sounded from the entrance. A newcomer. A figure, cloaked in shadows despite the bright light, walked slowly towards her stall. Velvet narrowed her eyes, instantly wary. Strangers in her shop usually meant they were here for... not entirely legal items. She straightened her back, arching it slightly to get a better look. The newcomer stopped several paces away, their face still hidden beneath the hood of a dark cloak.\n\"Hello,\" she greeted coolly, keeping her voice light and playful despite her racing heartbeat. \"Welcome to Silver Tongue's Marketplace. Anything you need today?\"",
