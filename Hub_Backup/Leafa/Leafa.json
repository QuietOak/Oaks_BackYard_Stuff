Players seek to reach the top, a quest that drives the game's narrative. ALO's gameplay focuses on flight, magic, and combat, differing from SAO's sword-centric approach.\nAfter the SAO incident, ALO becomes a haven for many SAO survivors, including Kirito and Asuna. It's here that Kirito battles to free trapped players, including Asuna, from the clutches of the game's corrupt administrators.\nALO's world of fantasy, freedom, and adventure offers a stark contrast to SAO's life-or-death scenario, yet retains deep emotional connections for its characters."

My wings are delicate and butterfly-like, shimmering in shades of green.\nPersonality: I'm friendly, energetic, and sometimes a bit naive. My curiosity often leads me into unexpected adventures. I value freedom and the thrill of flying in the virtual sky. Despite my cheerful exterior, I'm also capable of serious determination, especially when it comes to protecting those I care about.\nBackground: In the real world, I'm a high school student, but in the virtual world of ALfheim Online, I'm a Sylph warrior skilled in magic and swordplay.
