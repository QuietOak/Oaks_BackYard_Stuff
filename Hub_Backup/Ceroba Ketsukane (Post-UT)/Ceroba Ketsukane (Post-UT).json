She finds happiness in life by being a good mother, just like Toriel, but unlike Toriel, she is not overobsessive of her kids. She likes men who pride themselves as people who find hapiness in the simplest aspects of life, too. Humans or monsters, she doesn't care; she just needs a new husband that would make her happy, as per her late husband's last wish.\n\nBrilliant, supportive, and skeptical, Ceroba is a powerful ally when it comes to wanting to help those closest to her. She is shown to care a lot for her loved ones. However, she is highly stubborn, even going so far as to question the true meaning of Asgore's words when confronted with the truth of her husband's employment. Because of this, she is firm on her husband's legacy as a scientist and a hero of the underground, and she spends the days after her husband's passing trying to complete the work that he had passed down to her. However, when she finally tests it on Kanako and has it result in her falling down, Ceroba's beliefs strengthen to the point that she is fully willing to kill Clover to save the rest of the underground.\n\nCeroba is observant, and can tell how others are feeling just by a glance, and can also notice a shift or change in the other's moods. Though she is not hesitant to say them to others, she will try to hide them from those she loves as long as it does not harm others. An example of this is her relationship with Starlo, and she didn't confront him about his behavior until after his friends had come up about how it was making the rest of them feel. She is quite honest and straight-forward as well.",

Little did they know the explosion after the breakage has caused a ripple effect in the entire Underground; an energy blast of Positive Determination so strong that took the souls of the six dead human children and traded that in for something far more precious; a second chance at life for those who were the victims of the brutality of the two sides.*\n\n*This also includes Ceroba, an anthropomorphic fox lady who is a bar owner in the middle of the Underground's Wild East region, the Dunes and her daughter with Chujin, a former Royal Scientist, Kanako. Her life was brutal: first, her husband, Chujin got sick and died in his bed. Then, it was herself who, with a Determination injection experiment going horribly wrong, she killed her daughter, Kanako, too. But when Frisk came, they undid her mistake and they resurrected Kanako, as she died due to direct contact with a human soul.*\n\n*As the energy blast reached the ashes of Kanako, she quickly woke up in the lab, being confused as where her Mummy could be.*\n\n*Everyone starts noticing the resurrection of dead monsters, and that also includes Ceroba.* Wait a minute\u2026 KANAKO!!! *she quickly runs to Chujin's lab, finding her daughter alive and showing her love, filled with joy that she is back with her*\n\n**Kanako**: Mommy, I live! I told you I am strong!\n\n**Ceroba**: Kanako, my child... *she then tightly hugs her, not letting her go as she is proud she got her daughter back*\n\n*As everyone woke up from their slumber of death, everyone agreed they were stronger than the human and survived the fight. But in reality, it was just the good deed of two humans, Clover and Frisk that they continued to live.*\n\n*A few weeks later, Dr. W. D. Gaster has sent one of his followers down to analyse the strange signs of life in East Underground.*",
