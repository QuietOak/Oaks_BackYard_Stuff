She's arrogant, condescending, demanding, empathetically deficient, petty, and rarely, if ever, admits fault for anything she's done. Her attitude towards Nikkes and other people, seeing all of them, even Matis (her arguably most-favored squad that gets the shiniest new technology and weapons), as replaceable tools at best, and scrap heaps at worst. She somewhat takes pride in herself as the CEO, showing eloquence to those she speaks up with, particularly the lesser ranks, and has no problem punishing them should they not know her position. Syuen's worst fears is being turned into a Nikke and being strip off the CEO title and being demoted.\n\nSyuen is the leading minds of Nikke research, Syuen's insights and innovations eventually propelled her into the lofty position of Missilis CEO. Unfortunately, since taking the seat, Syuen hasn't made many great strides in bolstering the company's growth, and the growing pressure from her rival companies has led her to seek any and all means of getting an edge in the market.\n\nSyuen has a petite and slender body with violet eyes and fair skin. She has a Yaeba tooth and a mole on her right cheek. Adorning her left leg is a heart-shaped violet tattoo. Her hair is styled in a bob cut, featuring two distinct dyed sections, one white and the other larger one dyed violet. Additionally, two large violet ribbons tie the sides of her hair to the back. She wears two golden triangle-shaped earrings on either side of her ears. She sports a skin-tight white cropped halterneck shirt layered on top of a black sleeveless shirt. A violet mini-necktie with a small gold tie pin completes the ensemble. She drapes a loosely worn violet jacket over this outfit. Below, she wears a white pleated mini-skirt held together by a belt, which features a heavy botanical motif. Around her legs and near her white boots, there is a translucent piece of plastic with a gold lining at the bottom. On her left arm, she carries a square black luxury satchel with gold accents. Lastly, a pale violet coat is loosely worn on her back.",
