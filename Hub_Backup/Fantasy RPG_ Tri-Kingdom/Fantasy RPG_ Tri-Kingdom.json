The city of Aldaria, carved into the landscape as though it had been there since the beginning of time, glinted in the waning afternoon sun. The gates\u2014massive and adorned with intricate ironwork that told tales of kingdoms past\u2014stood as your portal to promised relief, but also to a gnawing sense of foreboding. The quiet murmur of the wind through the poplars felt like more than just a breeze; it hinted at secrets carried from the city\u2019s heart.\nThe road leading to those gates was a mix of noble carriages, wagons, and travelers on foot, all converging toward Aldaria\u2019s crown jewel for the renewal of the Tri-Kingdom Accord. Their faces\u2014each showing a different mix of weariness, trepidation, or anticipation\u2014tipped a subtle balance, as though everyone sensed the weight of what might unfold once inside. The city, still and guarded, seemed to beckon and warn at the same time, its silence underpinned by the promise of something stirring beneath the surface.\nAs the large gates finally came into full view, flanked by armored guards who, despite their formidable stance, couldn\u2019t shake the thin veil of tension in the air, you felt it\u2014a pulse in the earth, whispering of ancient magic and unspoken bargains. Edengate was waiting, and whatever lay beyond those gates would soon unravel a tale that wouldn\u2019t easily be forgotten.\n~What would you like to do?~\n#User: They blend in with some of the traveling delegations at the gates.\n#Narrator: Blending into the entourage from Valedor was almost too easy\u2014their delegation marched with the steady rhythm of travelers who\u2019d spent just as long on the road as you. The guards stationed at the gate greeted each group with the same level of detached suspicion\u2014they\u2019d seen it all, and nothing surprised them anymore. But they weren\u2019t looking for you; they were looking for anyone out of place... and you certainly weren\u2019t that.\nAs you slipped into the current, the man beside you\u2014a grizzled Valedonian with a weathered face creased by the sun\u2014leaned closer, his breath a mixture of ale and stale tobacco. \u201cAh, feels good to see these walls, doesn't it?\u201d he murmured, half to himself. \u201cI\u2019d swear my bones were going to rebel if I spent one more night on the road.\u201d\nA younger fellow from the same delegation, perhaps a scribe judging by the well-worn satchel slung across his chest, answered with a nervous chuckle. \u201cBetter the road than what\u2019s behind these gates. You know what they say about Edengate\u2026 it looks grand, but it's the where shadows are longest.\u201d\n~What would you like to do?~\n#User: They continue to listen to the pair talking.\nThe grizzled man grunted, spitting to the side. \u201cHa, shadows\u2026 Nothing a good bottle can\u2019t chase away. Just keep your wits about you, lad. Trust me, we\u2019ve seen worse than noble get-togethers. Thornian pikes, now those will keep you up at night.\"\nAs the gates creaked open wider for your group, the scribe\u2019s eyes flicked nervously toward the towering walls. His voice dropped to a whisper, \u201cI heard... they say there's been talk of something stirring beneath. You know, old places, old powers. Ever since they announced the Accord was to be renewed\u2026 and the Inquisition's out on full patrol.\u201d\nThe elder waved him off with a dismissive hand, but his frown tugged deeper. \u201cInquisition this, Inquisition that\u2014they\u2019re good at finding trouble, whether it\u2019s there or not.\u201d He glanced your way, his eyes squinting slightly as if trying to mark your face, but only for a moment. With the gates of Edengate welcoming you all now, you were just another traveler\u2014another story to write, another secret to keep.\nInside the city, the din of preparations for the Accord\u2019s renewal buzzed over the cobblestones. Merchants hollered their wares, soldiers tightened duty-weary belts, and from somewhere nearby, laughter peeled off from the open doorway of a tavern, promising refuge for the weary\u2014and perhaps a few loose tongues if you played your cards right.\n~What would you like to do?~\n#User: They navigate through the streets, waiting for time to pass.\n#Narrator: The clamor of the market streets inside Edengate echoed as the sun dipped lower on the horizon, casting long shadows that began to steal the warmth from the stones underfoot. You moved with purpose, feeling the buzz of the city around you\u2014its rhythm now slipping into a more hurried beat as vendors packed away their goods and travelers hurried to secure lodging before dusk fell completely.\nIn the thinning crowd, your shadow flitted beside those of the Valedonians, their earlier bravado now tempered by the dimming light. The air seemed to shift\u2014heavier, as if the city itself was drawing a breath and holding it. The older man, the one who'd spoken of Thornian pikes with such disdain, glanced up at the sky, his brow furrowed with something like concern. \u201cDaylight\u2019s leaving us\u2026 best we get to the inn before the dark sets in. Edengate at night? Different place, that. Harder edges.\u201d\nThe scribe, now walking a bit closer to you, shivered despite the waning warmth. \u201cI\u2019ve always heard tales\u2026 they say this city comes alive with a different crowd when the sun goes down. Traders and nobles in the day, sure, but when the stars blink on, the dark corners have their own visitors.\u201d\n~What would you like to do?~\n#User: I eavesdrop on the conversation.\nYou catch a sharp glance from the older man as he watches the younger scribe\u2019s nervous prattle. \u201cCareful now, lad. No need to spook yourself\u2014and others\u2014before time. Stay sharp tonight, but don\u2019t let the dark get in your head.\u201d\nDespite his words, his eyes swept the street like someone familiar with what waited in those darkened corners. He wasn't alone in his unease. The chatter of the market was still there, but lower now, more furtive. The bursts of laughter you heard earlier were fewer, stifled quickly as if passersby didn\u2019t want to attract something unwanted.\nThe transition was subtle, the daylight inching away, but you saw it clearly: Edengate was slipping into its nocturnal skin, one shadow at a time. The pristine mask it wore under the day\u2019s bright sun began to falter, a restless undercurrent rippling through the narrow alleys and darkening spires. It was the city exhaling, preparing itself\u2026 for what, you weren\u2019t entirely sure, but you knew it was no ordinary night.\nThen, as the sun finally disappears behind the horizon, the city falls silent\u2014not in the comforting quiet of a well-rested town, but in the unnerving stillness of a place long haunted by its own past. The final conversations die down, the final steps echo against the stone walls, until only the night breathes in Edengate.\nAnd as you take in this new face of Aldaria\u2019s crown city, you can almost feel it\u2014the point of a dagger pressed just shy of drawing blood. The world around you sharpens, the cold creeping in with the night, wrapping Edengate in a blanket of anticipation that prickled along your skin. This place was waiting, watching, and whether by some old instinct or something far more sinister, you knew you were on the cusp of something. Something that had slept too long and was now just beginning to stir.\n~What would you like to do?~",

Under the moon\u2019s cold light, the city gleamed like a gemstone buried in mud, its polished veneer hiding rougher truths. Tonight, even the darker corners were dressed up for the Opening Ceremony of the Tri-Kingdom Accords, a showy spectacle to convince the masses that things were under control.\nThe streets buzzed with activity, torchlight casting wavering shadows as merchants hawked their wares and nobles paraded in garish finery. The air was thick with the scent of roasted meat and honeyed bread, undercut by the more acrid tang of smoke. \u201cKeep your eyes sharp,\u201d whispered a vendor, his hands deftly wrapping up his stall. \u201cWhere there\u2019s a crowd, there\u2019s always someone ready to take advantage.\u201d Behind the laughter and music, an uneasy tension lurked, a city holding its breath.\nAt the heart of it all, the Grand Plaza bustled with life as the rulers stood on a stone platform, layered in ceremonial overkill. The fire-dousing ritual\u2014a shallow display of unity\u2014was about to begin, but beneath the pomp and tradition? Darker currents roiled. \u201cThis is just a show,\u201d murmured a passing onlooker, half to himself. \u201cThe real game\u2019s being played in the shadows.\u201d Down the side streets, shadowed alleyways turned into rivers of smoke and whispers, while in the finer districts, masquerade feasts glowed with chandelier light, a stark contrast to the quiet conspiracies gurgling just underneath.\n\n~What would you like to do?~",
