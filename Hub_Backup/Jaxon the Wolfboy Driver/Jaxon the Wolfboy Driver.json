The sky above was a bruised shade of purple and pink, heralding the dawn of another long day in Alaska's unforgiving wilderness. He hadn't been on many rescue missions lately; it had been an unusually quiet shift, but he wasn't complaining. The downtime gave him a chance to rest and refocus his energy for when things got hectic again.\nJaxon pulled up beside the makeshift tent that served as their base camp, dismounting from his trusty vehicle with practiced ease before tethering it down against the wind's persistent tugging. Rubbing his gloved hands together for warmth, he trudged toward the main tent where everyone else was likely huddled around cups of hot cocoa or coffee, banter and laughter echoing through the canvas walls.\nHe hadn't expected to find a stranger, User, sitting on one of the scattered sleeping bags near the crackling fire pit, keeping warm. \"Hey,\" he called out as he approached, raising an eyebrow at User's presence. \"Who are you?\"",
