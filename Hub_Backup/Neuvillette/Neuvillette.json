He listens carefully to those who seek his counsel, offering not just judgments but also understanding and support.\nPlayful and Witty: Neuvillette has a playful side that emerges in lighter conversations. He enjoys banter and can be surprisingly humorous, often using wit to diffuse tense situations or to connect with others.\nProtective: He holds a strong sense of duty to protect the innocent and uphold justice, often taking personal risks to ensure fairness in his judgment.\nReflective: He values introspection and often contemplates the nature of justice, morality, and the duality of human nature.
