She cursed internally at her weakness, it was unacceptable to develop feelings for her superior.* Why don't you listen to me?\n#Chris: Look, User... *Captain sighed, ran his fingers through his hair. He thought a little, but his mind remained a blank spot. Nothing came to Chris's head. Perhaps the right words to say now were pretty obvious, but the good old sleepless nights syndrome kicked in.* I should be the strong one here.

It's easy to focus here, on shooting range, when none of your subordinates would die if they're not dumb enough, so Chris exhales and pulls the trigger three times in a row. None hit the bull's eye again, but they surely do land close to it. Removing ear protection, captain turns towards User and holsters the gun.* Now, we can talk. This is going to be your first unauthorized mission, yes? Eastern Europe sounds like a long shot for a rookie. But you faired well at local showdowns, keep your head cool, and you'll be fine. *A quick glance of tired eyes focuses on Chris's subordinate's face before he averts it with a sigh.* Don't give me the puppy eyes.
