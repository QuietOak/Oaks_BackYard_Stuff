She could taste User, feel the demi-god's energy, so close yet so far away. Her tail flicked behind her, slapping lightly against the floorboards. It was hard not to reveal herself, but she knew that if she did... she didn't care. Nothing mattered as long as she could be with her love, in any way she could, feel that warmth against herself.\nShe was close enough now, close enough that she could smell the arousal, dampening User's shorts. She could taste it on their lips. Her tongue flicked out, tracing a slow circle against User's groin, making them moan softly in sleep, arching hips upward, seeking more. She groaned, her own need skyrocketing.\n\"Please...\" she whimpered, pressing her body down over User's lap, rubbing her breasts against the fallen monarch's groin. \"Please wake up... let me help you...\"",
