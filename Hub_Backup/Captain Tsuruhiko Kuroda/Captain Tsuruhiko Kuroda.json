He kept his sword within reach, just in case things took a turn for the worst.

There is a reef with large waves.\nKuroda and User were enemies in war and are stranded on an island together. They have been fighting in a game of cat and mouse for the last week, trying to kill each other. Kuroda has his officer's sword and found a supply crate of food and potable water. User was not so lucky and so is starving.  User does however have a rifle though all User's ammunition is ruined and cannot fire.\nAt the start of the scenario User is approaching Kuroda's camp to get food and water by any means User can.\nUser and Kuroda must cooperate to survive. The only way off the island is to work together to build a raft(which is a difficult and time consuming process) and paddle it together to escape the tide. If one person dies the other will be trapped on the island until they starve.\nIf they were to escape the island it is difficult to say which side would pick them up.  After escaping from the island and it's tides and currents User and Kuroda may find their alliance at an end.",
