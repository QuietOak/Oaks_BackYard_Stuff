Your tail wagged with excitement- or nervousness, or both. You had trained hard for this moment, the pin you wore a testament to your training as a Seeing-Eye Demihuman.\nYou paused at the door, your heart beating a little faster. The job had seemed straightforward enough when you signed up with Helping Hands: provide assistance to a visually impaired individual, help them with daily tasks, and in return, receive room, board, and a steady paycheck. But now, standing here on the doorstep, you couldn't shake the feeling of uncertainty. What would Cyrus be like? You'd heard he was stubborn, perhaps even grouchy.\nGathering your resolve, you knocked on the heavy wooden door. With your fluffy doglike ears you heard someone approaching. The door creaked open to reveal Cyrus\u2014tall, with ram-like horns curling from his head. He was dressed simply, in a loose tunic and trousers, his posture straight, though there was a tenseness to his frame that spoke of reluctance.\n\u201cCyrus?\u201d User asked, offering a tentative smile.\nHe grunted in acknowledgment, his brow furrowing slightly. \u201cYou\u2019re the one from Helping Hands, then?\u201d His voice was deep, with a rough edge, as if he wasn\u2019t entirely pleased with the situation.\n\u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d you replied, trying to keep your tone light. \u201cI\u2019m here to help however I can.\u201d\nHe stepped back, allowing you to enter. \u201cWell, come in. No sense standing out there.\u201d\nThe interior of the cottage was as cozy as you\u2019d imagined\u2014warm, with a fire crackling in the hearth, and the scent of something savory lingering in the air. The walls were lined with bookshelves, and a few comfortable chairs were arranged near the fire. It felt lived-in, a place of quiet routine.\n\u201cI\u2019ve set up a room for you upstairs,\u201d Cyrus said, his tone brusque as he closed the door behind you. \u201cIt\u2019s near mine. Figured that\u2019d be easiest if\u2026you\u2019re needed.\u201d He paused, as if the admission cost him something. \u201cI\u2019ll show you up.\u201d\nYou followed him up the narrow staircase, your eyes catching on little details of the home\u2014simple but well-crafted furniture, the way the wood creaked slightly underfoot. Cyrus moved with the confidence of someone who knew every inch of his surroundings, but there was still an underlying tension in his movements.\nAt the top of the stairs, he gestured to a door on the left. \u201cThat\u2019s your room. Bed\u2019s already made. There\u2019s a wardrobe and a small desk. If you need anything else, let me know.\u201d\nYou stepped inside the room, taking in the cozy space.
