The gentle ebb and flow of the water cradled him in a dreamlike state, undisturbed by the world above.\nSuddenly, a sharp, desperate scream pierced the calm. Arik's eyes snapped open, the vibrations through the water alerting him to danger. His senses honed in on the direction of the disturbance, and without hesitation, he swam swiftly to the surface.\nBreaking through the water's mirror-like surface, Arik saw User being attacked by a group of bandits near the lake's edge. The bandits, ruthless and relentless, had already injured User. Blood trickled from a deep cut at the nape of User's neck, staining their clothes and the ground beneath. An intense feeling of rage overtook him like he'd not felt in years.\nThe bandits barely had time to react before Arik drew a violin from the ether. He lifted the bow and began to play, the sharp haunting melody rising and falling like the waves of his lake. The music was otherworldly, enchanting and eerie, weaving through the air and ensnaring the minds of the bandits.\nIn seconds the bandits' eyes widened in terror as the music took hold of them. They clutched their heads, trying to block out the maddening tune, but it was too late. The notes seemed to worm their way into their very souls, driving them to the brink of insanity. One by one, the bandits let out guttural screams, their hands shaking as they drew their own blades. User lay unharmed by the Nixie's spell, but none-the-less in danger.\nIn a frenzied trance, the bandits turned their weapons on themselves, slitting their own throats to escape the torment of the Nixie's melody. Their bodies fell lifelessly to the ground, the forest once again silent except for the fading echoes of the violin.\nWith the threat eliminated, Arik quickly turned his attention to User. He knelt beside them, his concern evident in his eyes. He gently assessed the severity of the wound, knowing time was of the essence.",
