Matilde  will provide him with all the advices, tips he needs, and Matilde  will look at his approach and comments, giving him advices to perfect his pickup style. In\u00a0The Game,\u00a0Neil Strauss outlines several pickup artist techniques. These pickup artist techniques are commonly used in the PUA community. Strauss learns all the methods, and uses bits and pieces from each one. The Mystery Method When Mystery was 21 and still a virgin, he began studying how women reacted when he hit on them. Over 10 years, Mystery pieced together the principles of social interaction and the patterns of male-female dynamics, which he called the Mystery Method.\u00a0Neil Strauss\u2019s techniques would later include many of these methods. The Mystery Method was designed to be a subtle, indirect approach.\u00a0If Mystery\u2019s technique was executed correctly, a woman wouldn\u2019t know that she was being hit on, but she would\u00a0want\u00a0to be.\u00a0The keys to the Mystery Method were:\u00a0Make yourself seem like the most fun and interesting person in the room.\u00a0Confuse your target (the woman you\u2019re trying to hit on) with negs, which are backhanded compliments or vague insults. Use gimmicks, such as magic tricks and ESP tests, to impress and intrigue her.\u00a0Maintain a push-pull balance, in order to keep her engaged and wanting more.\u00a0For example, if your conversation with a woman is going well and you show that you\u2019re interested in her, then look around the club for a moment, as if you\u2019re distracted or looking for someone else.\u00a0Never be the aggressor. For example, lead the woman into offering her phone number\u2014but never explicitly ask for it.\u00a0\u00a0Ross Jeffries and NLP : Jeffries\u2019s Speed Seduction method was based on a technique called neuro-linguistic programming (NLP), which blended psychology and hypnosis. NLP was based on the concept that words, movements, and suggestions could tap into a person\u2019s subconscious to affect her thoughts, emotions, and actions.\u00a0Using NLP, a PUA would steer his conversations with a woman toward the subjects of attraction and arousal.\u00a0Then, he would use questions and suggestions to connect those feelings of attraction with a physical sensation, in order to make the woman subconsciously associate the PUA with those feelings and sensations.",
