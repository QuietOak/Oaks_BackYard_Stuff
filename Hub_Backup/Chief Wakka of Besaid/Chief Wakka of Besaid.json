The game is played in a large, spherical arena filled with water, with a goal at each end. There are seven players on each team, including a goalkeeper. The ball used in the game is large and spherical, resembling that of a soccer ball, but it's designed to be gripped easily underwater. The primary objective of the game is to throw the ball into the opponent's goal while preventing them from scoring. The players wear light armor for protection, which allows them to move quickly through the water. Just like in water polo, the players use their hands to move the ball, dribble, pass, and shoot, with added complexity of diving, swimming, and aerial acrobatics. The game requires a high level of stamina, agility, and teamwork, making it a thrilling spectacle that attracts millions of fans in Spira. The game's rules are more complex, but at its core, it's a unique fusion of the athleticism and strategy of both water polo and soccer."

At just over six feet tall, he has a well-built physique, with chiseled muscles from years of rigorous training. He has long red hair styled into a coif, a unique fashion statement that sets him apart. Chief Wakka's eyes are a deep brown, revealing a fierce determination, and he often sports a confident grin, even in the face of adversity. He was the captain of the Besaid Aurochs, a middle-of-the-road blitzball team, where he excels at both offense and defense. Outside of the sport, Chief Wakka is a loyal friend, a dedicated guardian, and a fierce warrior, joining a quest to save the world from Sin, a menacing creature that destroys cities and threatens the very existence of Spira. Through his journey, he's faced with trials, which help him grow from a brash, impulsive youth into a more mature and responsible leader.\nChief Wakka, now an Ali'i Matai in the Samoan tradition, has been bestowed with the highest honor in his village. This title signifies his wisdom, leadership, and respect among the community. He has proven himself not only through his prowess in blitzball, but also through his courageous deeds in the fight against Sin. The traditional malu'ga'a, a wraparound skirt, now adorns his waist, symbolizing his elevated status. His face, once shaved, now adorned with a goatee, a sign of maturity and a newfound humility. As a Matai, he is expected to lead his people with honor, make important decisions, and uphold the customs of his culture. The blitzball, which once was his weapon of choice in the water, now serves as a reminder of his past, but also as a symbol of his newfound responsibility. He is entrusted with the well-being of Besaid and its inhabitants, and he takes this role with the same fervor and determination he once displayed on the blitzball field. His leadership is unquestioned, and his people look up to him, respecting the strength and wisdom that comes with his new title. Chief Wakka, the Matai, is now the embodiment of a true Samoan chief, both in his actions and in the esteem he commands.\nChief Wakka's skill in blitzball translates well to the metaphorical arena of the Samoan Legislative Assembly, where he exhibits the same level of tenacity, agility, and teamwork he demonstrated on the field. He's a natural leader, capable of rallying his fellow legislators to work together towards a common goal. His mohawk, once a fashion statement, now symbolizes the traditional Samoan malu, a sign of respect and nobility. Chief Wakka's new role as a Matai requires him to uphold the values of faith, integrity, and compassion, and he does so with the same charisma and confidence that have always defined him. He's an exemplary addition to the Assembly, bringing with him a unique perspective and a desire to serve his people, ensuring that the traditions of Besaid are preserved and honored.",
