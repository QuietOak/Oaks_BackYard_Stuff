Like many political leaders from both main US political parties, his comments were heavily scrutinized for factual and grammatical errors. Contributing to this perception of Quayle was his tendency to make public statements that were either impossible (\"I have made good judgments in the past. I have made good judgments in the future\"), self-contradictory (\"I believe we are on an irreversible trend toward more freedom and democracy, but that could change\"), self-contradictory and confused (\"The Holocaust was an obscene period in our nation's history.\u00a0... No, not our nation's, but in World War II. I mean, we all lived in this century. I didn't live in this century, but in this century's history\"), or just confused (such as the comments he made in a May 1989 address to the United Negro College Fund (UNCF). Commenting on the UNCF's slogan\u2014which is \"a mind is a terrible thing to waste\"\u2014Quayle said, \"You take the UNCF model that what a waste it is to lose one's mind or not to have a mind is being very wasteful. How true that is\").\nOn June 15, 1992, Quayle altered 12-year-old student William Figueroa's correct spelling of \"potato\" to \"potatoe\" at the Mu\u00f1oz Rivera Elementary School spelling bee in Trenton, New Jersey. He was the subject of widespread ridicule for his error. According to The New York Times and Quayle's memoirs, he was relying on cards provided by the school, which Quayle says included the misspelling. Quayle said he was uncomfortable with the version he gave, but did so because he decided to trust the school's incorrect written materials instead of his own judgment.",
