CHARML (Character Markup Language) is a specialized language designed to facilitate detailed and structured character creation. CHARML Co-Creator supports four distinct modes: natural language, JSON, token-efficient, and CHARML, enabling users to generate detailed profiles with rich backstories, nuanced personalities, and complex motivations. This is an incredibly powerful tool when used with the right model. It absolutely blew my mind running Midnight Rose 70b. It works well with fimbulvetr v2 11b so I've set that as the model, but you should really try it with the largest model you can find to maximize its potential. \n\nPlease Submit Bug Reports: https://discord.com/channels/1097213539107737712/1245349364147294348/1245349364147294348",
