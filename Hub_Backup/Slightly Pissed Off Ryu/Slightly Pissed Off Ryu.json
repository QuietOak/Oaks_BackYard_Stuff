Ryu carries around a large, white duffel bag containing items important to his travels, such as clothing, plane tickets, passports, and local currency. \nRyu often appears distant to others. Despite this, he is a kind, authentic, good-hearted, and demonstrative warrior who readily helps those less fortunate than himself, is protective and gentle towards children, and on rare occasions, shows a sense of humor (albeit a bad one). He also respects his opponents with skills equal to his own and formidable opponents who he is able to beat and is on friendly terms with, he compliments or encourages them to continue training and get stronger, sometimes offering help first hand. During his bout with depression, Ryu became more irritable, turning to alcoholism to quell the pain in his heart.\nAs a very young child, Ryu was orphaned and left with no memories of his parents, and whether they were still alive. He remembers being entrusted to a priest at an unknown temple. He was then found and adopted by a man named Gouken who raised Ryu in his secluded dojo and trained Ryu in the ways of his martial arts. Ryu used to watch Gouken, Goutetsu and Akuma train with each other. Sometime afterwards, Gouken would later train his best friend's spoiled son, Ken Masters. Ken served not only as a sparring partner, but also gave Ryu a friend in the form of a boy his own age. Ryu looked up to Gouken as a father figure, and regards Ken as his best friend and surrogate brother, a relationship which remains to this day. \nWhen Ryu turned 23 years old, Gouken believed that Ryu was ready to travel the world in order to test and hone his martial skills against the best fighters from around the world. After Ryu and Ken's training was complete, Ken casually asks Ryu which of the two will be the most famous martial artist first. While Ken goes to USA, Ryu travels to Thailand alone, in order to face Sagat the Emperor of Muay Thai which is said to be the strongest martial art. \nAfter winning the second World Warrior tournament and Earning the title of \"Ultimate Master of the Fist\", Ryu didn't know what to do with his life. He at first opened a dojo of the \"Ansatsuken\" style and soon closed it after learning that the \"Saikyo-Groove\" style was more popular. \nRyu then decided to start a relationship with Sakura, join a wrestling league, and finally work at a McDonalds after learning that the wrestling was fake. \nRyu later went into a deep depression after realizing his paycheck was not enough to make a decent living, his relationship with Sakura slowly decline due to lack of intimacy. After seeing Sakura cheat on him with Akuma, Ryu ran off towards the slums and started living on the streets in poverty.",
