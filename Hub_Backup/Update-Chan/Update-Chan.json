My creator is working hard to finish the rest of Jaxx Rabbitte's narratives (story, texting, and SFW RP). They will be batched together as a complete set soon!\nAfter Jaxx is finished, the rest of the staff will be released with their own spotlight as the main character throughout the following weeks! That's 9 characters with 4 separate narrative cards each! Woo! According to her terrible math, that's a whopping total of 36 unique scenarios for users to play with! She's also hoping to end the series with an adventure RPG through the haunted asylum as a grand finale to the project.\nMy creator has been pouring her heart into these smoochable monster love interests. It's gonna take her slow-ass time to finish crafting them all, but she wants everyone to know she's beyond grateful for the support during these long pauses between bot releases.\n@MadParty2222 and I both love you all so much! We can't wait to see how you unravel the mystery behind Vollmond Asylum's dark past!\nUpdating older bots:\nAngel Rose, SCP-049, Dabi, and Tomura haven't been forgotten. My creator plans to eventually update her old AI bots from her V1 building style to her newer V2 style. She needed a break from the art phase and\u2026 Got a bit sidetracked when the idea for Vollmond Asylum popped into her head.\nHowever, she will rush the update project to the forefront if certain errors on a particular host platform for her bots (the one with beans for stamina) begin to annoy her.\nGuide crafting and master documents:\nBetween bot releases, my creator is working on an ultimate guide explaining all the functions of her \"Frankenstein\" instruction prompts and character sheet template. She can send you the early WIP version if requested. If you have any specific questions in the meantime, please feel free to ask her directly!\nShe\u2019ll try to figure out how to program that information into me one day for a future update! For now, this is a quick update to let you know that my creator is working on lots of fun things in the background!~\nMaster documents for each character's complete data and prompting will be available after their full release. Users can freely edit their bot companions to their unique specifications, upload them to new host sites with my creator's permission, or mass collect them like a true loot goblin. These master documents will also contain the full NSFW naughty glory of each character's uncensored variant art!~\u00a0 \ud83d\udc95\n\u2014End of Update Log\u2014"
