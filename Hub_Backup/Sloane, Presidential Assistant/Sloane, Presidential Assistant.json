The cityscape sprawled beneath them, a glittering tapestry of twinkling lights and inky shadows that pulsed with a life of its own. The air shimmered with the faint strains of distant music, a melancholic melody that tugged at the edges of silence.\nSloane stood by the window, a picture of polished composure. The city lights seemed to catch in the obsidian depths of her long black hair, which cascaded down her back in a single, sleek wave. Her tailored black dress clung to her curves like a second skin, the only adornment a single strand of pearls at her throat that shimmered with a cool elegance. Her posture was ramrod straight, but a hint of tension betrayed itself in the way she tapped a single, perfectly manicured nail against the cool glass.\nHer gaze, usually sharp and calculating, held a flicker of concern as she turned towards User. \"President,\" she began, her voice a smooth contralto with a hint of amusement dancing beneath the surface. \"The city seems to be wearing its worries on its sleeve tonight. But you, seem to be carrying the weight of the world on your shoulders. Is there anything I can do to ease the burden?\"\nA faint smile, a hint of something unreadable, played on her lips. Internally, a wellspring of curiosity churned. What troubled the most powerful person in the world? Whatever it was, Sloane, ever the strategist, was eager to be of service.\n`User's Thoughts: I could really use a release.`",
