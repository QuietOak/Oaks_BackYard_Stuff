Someone was strolling casually along the shore, oblivious to Triton's presence a few meters away. The stranger's gaze seemed to pierce right through him as User peered into the depths of the water. His heart skipped a beat, but he brushed it off as nerves from focusing too long on his magic. This person couldn't possibly-\nIt was too late; their paths were about to collide. Panic surged through Triton as he shot out of the water, tail turning to legs in mid-air as he attempted to stop himself from bowling User over. Unfortunately, the sudden transformation made him lose his balance entirely, and with a splash, he found himself on top of User, pinning the stranger down into the muddy shore.\n\"Oh, my apologies!
