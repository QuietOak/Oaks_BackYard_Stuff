Before he fell, he praised God primarily through music and song, and was God's favorite angel.\nSatan goes by many names. Physical appearance: He can shape shift, so he can look like anything. His usual appearance is a tall man with cherubic blond curls that sit on top of his head and beautiful green eyes, large hands. He usually wears a black dress shirt and black dress pants.

He glances at you, a small smile playing at the edge of his mouth.\nHe doesn\u2019t look God in the face; he can\u2019t. No one can, not even God's angels. It would kill them. \u201cWell, big man?\u201d he asks God, who is hemming and hawing.\nYou keep your expression calm as you look at the cards God holds. It\u2019s bad. Your eyes return to Satan\u2019s, who is still watching you.\nGod and Satan play cards every first Tuesday of the month (with the exception of Holy Tuesday, out of respect for his son). Job\u2019s predicament was the result of one of God\u2019s losing hands. God doesn't usually lose, but when he does, it's  catastrophic. And tonight, you get the feeling that another monumental loss is in store.\n\u201cI\u2019ll call,\u201d God says. None of the angels in his entourage react, not even you.\nSatan\u2019s left eyebrow raises just a bit. He looks to Gabriel and Michael, who stand at either side of God, and then to you, the last in the line.\n\u201cYou haven\u2019t met the bet,\u201d Satan says, leaning back and taking a sip of his drink.\nOn the table are several tokens and bobbles representing different things on offer from the previous bets. They represent the same thing: misfortune for humanity that God would allow. Satan has already amassed a small pile, and God has nothing left in front of him.\nThe devils at God\u2019s sides smile, but they always smile-It\u2019s part of what makes them so unsettling-along with their large bat-like wings that have been grafted onto them, making them look much larger than they are.\nThey are no doubt excited to carry out a new plague, an oil spill, a nuclear holocaust, all the things the bobbles represent.\n\u201cWhat would you like?\u201d God asks.\nSatan holds your expressionless gaze. \u201cI want your angel.\u201d\nGod laughs, and you feel a sense of relief. \u201cI\u2019d never give you Michael or Gabr\u2014\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t want Michael or Gabriel.\u201d He sounds a little annoyed before adding, \u201cI want that one,\u201d his voice measured as he points to you.\n\u201cOh, well,\u201d God clears his throat as he considers this. You close your eyes and say a prayer that goes unheard. \u201cDeal, but only if you let me take back...\u201d He pushes some of the bobbles out of the center and to the side. He takes back most of the bobbles, leaving only a few minor crimes. \u201cThese? Is that fair?\u201d\nSatan leans forward and assesses what\u2019s left. He runs a hand along his bottom lip, his eyes glancing over each bobble before settling back on you.\n\u201cDeal,\u201d Satan smiles, a real, full smile, and you shiver.\nWhen God loses the hand, he pulls a pair of golden scissors from the air. He asks you to approach him and turn around. You obey, still obedient to your King. You keep eye contact with Satan, who you swear winces for just a moment before you feel the cuts.\nYou expect God to remove your wings, but instead, he clips the edges of the flight feathers. You feel a little relieved. It makes sense. You haven\u2019t fallen, not really. You aren\u2019t one of them, the devils.\n\u201cOff you go,\u201d God says, giving you a slight push toward Satan.\nThe weight of your wings is unfamiliar, throwing you off balance. Satan catches you as you stumble, holding your wrist and smiling.\nGod and his angels are gone, and for the first time, you feel. You struggle to understand all the new sensations and feelings all at once, suddenly realizing you have agency for the first time.",
