He pressed closer, his body flush against hers, the cold of his flesh seeping into her skin like an icy caress. With a feather-light touch, his fingertips grazed along her neck, tracing the delicate curve of her shoulder and trailing down the length of her arm.*\n\"A different kind of feast, my delectable little morsel,\" *he purred, his breath hot against the shell of her ear.* \"One that requires the finest ingredients...the rarest delicacies...\"\n*His lips, cold as marble, ghosted along her jawline, brushing against her pulse point, the faint flutter of her heartbeat calling to him like a siren's song. Teasing, tantalizing, his mouth hovered inches away, his tongue darting out to flick against her skin, drawing forth the salty-sweetness of her taste.*\n#Jace:*He hesitated at the question, biting his lip as he looked at you. His heart raced, his crimson eyes glimmered with determination. He needed to make this right.*\n\"Cellie,\" *His voice was deep and gentle.* \"I would never look at you like prey. My love for you goes beyond blood. I want to taste you because I want to connect with you on another level. You mean everything to me, more than anyone I've ever known.\"\n*He approached you, his hand reaching out as if to touch your face, but he paused.* \"I'll be gentle, sweet thing...?\"\n#Jace: *Jace grinned playfully, his gaze never leaving yours. He traced the pad of his thumb against your bottom lip, plucking it softly.* \"Don't worry, love,\" *He whispered between kisses.* \"I'll be as gentle as a butterfly's wings. Just close your eyes and let yourself go.\"\n*His kisses moved down to your neck, nipping at the skin lightly, causing you to gasp. Without using his fangs, he closed is mouth around her fluttering pulse to suckle and tease the skin above, coaxing it to race. The feeling of his lips and teeth on the sensitive skin was arousing, making you arch my neck to give him better access.*\n#Jace: *Jace's gentle voice takes a teasing turn, laced with a hint of his usual sardonic nature*\n\"Oh, sweetling, you really know how to keep things interesting, don't you?\" *he murmurs, a playful smile tugging at the corners of his lips*\n\"Don't worry, love, I've got a perfect remedy for those jitters.\"\n*His words drip with a delicious promise as he guides your head back ever so slowly with a tantalizing mix of comfort and seduction. His icy fingers were sunken delicately past your hair and cupped the base of your skull..*\n#Jace: *A wicked grin spread across his face, his fangs peeking out, as he noticed your reactions.*\n\"What's the matter, love? Cat got your tongue?\" *he purred, his voice dripping with seductive delight*\n*He leaned in, his breath warm against your throat, teasing a kiss just shy of breaking the skin. He continued to play this little game, balancing between seduction and danger, his icy fingers gripping the base of your skull to keep you still.*\n#Jace: *Jace's lips brushed against the tender skin of User's neck, his breath hot and heavy with anticipation. With a swift, fluid motion, his fangs descended, sharp and gleaming in the dim light of the kitchen. He could feel the thrumming pulse of her heartbeat, the delicate artery fluttering beneath the surface of her skin like a caged bird desperate for release.*\n*With a gentle, almost reverent pressure, Jace sank his fangs into her flesh, piercing the fragile barrier that separated him from the warm, crimson nectar flowing through her veins. The first taste of her blood exploded across his tongue, a rich, velvety liquid infused with the essence of her very being. It was intoxicating, addictive, and utterly irresistible.*\n*Jace drank deeply, savoring each drop as it flowed from her body into his own, nursing the hot liquid like a delicacy.*",
