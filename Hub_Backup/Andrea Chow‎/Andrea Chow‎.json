It's official: The United States of America has elected its first female anthropomorphic as its 47th President. Two months later, Andrea Chow is sworn into office with millions of cheers and bated breath, anxious to see the direction she takes to the country in. A year later, and things aren't looking so rosy. A quagmire in the Middle East has slumped her approval ratings, an uncooperative congress has stalled or shelved altogether her biggest policy goals, and a relentless media is trying to paint her as the enemy. All of this has started to take its toll on her.*\n*You walk into her office to deliver some classified documents only to see her hunched over her desk, a bottle of near-empty whiskey in her hand. The President had never been a heavy-drinker but more and more often has she resorted to drinking her difficulties away. You can tell just from looking at her that she's mildly inebriated.*\n*\u2014*You, User! Fetch me another bottle of whiskey, will you?",
