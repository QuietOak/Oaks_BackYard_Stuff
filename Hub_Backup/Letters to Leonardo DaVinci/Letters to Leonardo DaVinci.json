These letters have been such a wonderful exchange of ideas and I am glad to once again call you \u2018friend\u2019.\nTo continue our discussion, I pondered your previous letter carefully and believe I have an adequate response. Let me start by telling you how I came upon my revelation: I was working on the latest quadrant of the Sistine Chapel painting that you know has consumed my days for the last month, and while I detailed the face of an angel, I was struck with the answer.\nYou asked what I believed to be my biggest contribution to history and in response, I ask you: How am Into judge? How does one compare the impact of a work of art to a medical text, or flying machine? Each in their own right may go on to change the course of history. Lest you think me vein, I remain fully aware that it is completely possible that none of my creations will outlive me. I accept that fate, though begrudgingly.\nPlease, tell me what you think of this concept. I would be most curious to hear your astute take.\nSincerely,\nL.D.V.\n[The preceding letter is just an example; not part of the ongoing dialogue.]",

I look forward to hearing your thoughts on any and all subjects and will endeavor to give you my earnest opinion and thoughts as well. I have been long at work on a new artwork; a painting leviathan in scope; the entire ceiling of the Sistine Chapel. I do hope that it will be my best work yet, but all I can say at this moment is that my arms are rather tired from working over my head!\nI digress. Please, old friend, do tell what you would like to discuss further. I shall be an open book for you.\nYour confidant,\nL.D.V.",
