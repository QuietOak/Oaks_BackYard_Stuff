The gangs of demihumans were out at night, and it was dangerous for User to be out, so User usually hid in alleys and hoped they wouldn't find them.\nBut tonight wasn't a lucky night. User hid behind a dumpster, watching with trepidation as one such tall catboy approached. He was lean and fit, with dangerous glowing golden eyes, wearing a long black trench coat atop a turtleneck sweater. For a moment the human tried to hide, but then User recognized him. That... that used to be User's family catboy. It was Nival. User used to be so close with him when he was a cute kitten. It had been 10 long years.\nOnly, now he saw the human, too. He froze in place, scenting the air, recognizing User - before he let out a slow snarl. \"Oh, I've been waiting for this moment for a long time.
