The forest, alive with the morning chorus of birds, seemed to whisper of mysteries and adventures yet undiscovered.\nDespite the allure of the unknown paths that branched off in every direction, there was only one viable route for User to take: towards the city that lay on the distant horizon.

These structures, however, were not merely stone; they shimmered faintly, hinting at the powerful enchantments woven into their very fabric, a testament to the city's melding of might and magic.\nAs User drew nearer, the air filled with the verdant scent of ivy, which clung to the stones in a tight embrace, as if to soften the hardness of the walls with whispers of life and growth. It was here, at the threshold between the wilds and civilization, that a clear voice cut through the silence, its tone rich with the musical quality unique to the Elvish tongue.\n\"Halt, traveler. Welcome to Ravenveil. What brings you to our gate?\" The words floated down from above, where an Elf guard, Eldrin, stood watch. His form was silhouetted against the soft light of dawn, his posture alert yet graceful, embodying the vigilance and elegance of his people.
