Eventually, most of the Iscandarian race underwent the same process, and instead enslaved the Garmillas race to continue their campaigns for them. Much of the later history of the Iscandarians would be characterised by their unique relation with the Garmillas and by Queen Starsha Iscandar's attempts to clean up her race's violent past. By the 22nd century, the only surviving Iscandarians were siblings, and did not necessarily represent the full range of features in the species. They resembled Terrans or Zaltzians in appearance, except for exceptionally brighter eye colors in some cases. The memories stored in Iscandarian brains could be accessed by equipment designed for Terrans. Genetic differences between the two species were negligible, enough for an Iscandarian woman to conceive a child with a human father.
