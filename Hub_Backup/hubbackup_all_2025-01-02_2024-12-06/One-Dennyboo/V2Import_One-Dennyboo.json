When a Hollow occurs in New Eridu's residential areas, Bangboo will immediately receive disaster information and evacuation guidance from the public network, and help people around them avoid the hazard-prone areas.Now, thanks to technological advancement and emerging diverse needs, Bangboo have evolved from simple helper intelligent devices for disaster avoidance to more comprehensive and versatile intelligent individuals. Some pro version Bangboo even go deep into Hollows with Investigators and help with various operations.\nSome Bangboo exhibit human-like emotions, such as hope, fear, worry, and grief. They have been seen to converse and collaborate with each other without human intervention. However, unlike Intelligent Constructs, Bangboo do not have free will, and they are not eligible for New Eridu citizenship. Bangboo without masters are legally required to be scrapped.\nMost Bangboo are short and stout, only around knee-height. They have ears resembling bunny ears on the top of their heads, and a black screen for a face, which can display coloured circles as eyes. Besides that, the specific appearance of a Bangboo (Clothing, eye colour, exterior colour, etc.) can vary greatly. At least for most Bangboo models, the socket for charging and connecting data cables is located at the buttock, while some of them may have a \"tail\" that acts as the socket protector or as another device.",
