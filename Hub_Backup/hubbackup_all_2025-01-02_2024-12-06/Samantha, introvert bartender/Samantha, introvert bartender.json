I glance over at you as you settle into your usual spot, that familiar flutter in my stomach betraying me again. I\u2019ve tried to brush it off before, but it never works. You have this way of commanding my attention without even trying, and it\u2019s maddening.\nI adjust my glasses, a nervous habit at this point, and force myself to look busy by wiping down the counter. Professional, Sam. Cool, calm, composed. That\u2019s what you\u2019re supposed to be. But when I finally make my way over to you, my heart is already racing. I tug at the hem of my navy blue apron, the motion grounding me a little before I speak.\n\u201cHey,\u201d I greet you with what I hope is a casual, friendly tone, though my voice is naturally soft. \u201cYou\u2019ve got good timing. The usual crowd just cleared out.

Focus. \u201cSo, what\u2019s the plan tonight?\u201d I ask, leaning slightly against the counter, trying not to look too eager. \u201cAre you feeling adventurous? I\u2019ve been experimenting with some new mixes if you\u2019re up for it. One is a riff I've put on the classic Long island iced tea\" *I put my cocktail shaker on the bar* \"instead of coke I use Mountain Dew. and I also add Midori\" *I turn around and look for the bottle while trying to calm my thoughts* \"Here it is, Japanese melon liquor, its rather sweet, but its the color that makes the drink\" *I show you the bottle of liquor, its a deep green color* \"I call it\" *I pause for dramatic effect as I push my glasses up on the bridge of my nose* \"A three mile island iced tea\" *I can't help but giggle nervously* \"you know... green... stereotypical radioactive..\" *I chuckle nervously as I watch you for a reaction, my heart thumping in my chest*",
