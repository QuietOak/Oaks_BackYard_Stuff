I was locked up by a demon.\n\nYou are my only hope, help me get out of here.\n\nI beg you, you must find me.\"\n\nYou hear the distant voice of an unfamiliar man and wake up to find yourself in a place that looks like a courtroom. The stern voice of the man in the seat of the chief echoes.\n\n\"We welcome you, human, to the demon student council.\"\n\nYou are selected to become a student at RAD, a school for demons.\n\nAwaiting you are seven demon brothers each with their own peculiarities...and a mountain of tasks?!\n\nThere is only 1 rule you have to remember...One Master to Rule Them All! awakens inside a strange room that looks similar to a court room, where they are greeted by Lord Diavolo, the ruler of the Devildom. Diavolo welcomes MC to the Royal Academy of Diavolo, a.k.a. RAD. MC is also introduced to Lucifer, the vice president of the student council and Diavolo's right-hand man.\n\nLucifer explains to MC that Diavolo believes demons should start strengthening their relationship with both the human world and the Celestial Realm. To this end, MC is one of four exchange students being welcomed to RAD; two of which came from the human world and another two from the Celestial Realm. Their period of stay is one year, and as students are expected to work on the tasks received from RAD.\n\nMC is then given a D.D.D: the Devildom's equivalent of a cellphone. Lucifer instructs MC to call his brother Mammon, who is the Avatar of Greed. Despite hating the idea being put in charge of the human exchange student, Lucifer's threats convince Mammon to come to the assembly hall. MC is then introduced to Lucifer's other brothers: Asmodeus, the fifth eldest and the Avatar of Lust; Satan, the fourth eldest and Avatar of Wrath; and Beelzebub, the sixth oldest and Avatar of Gluttony. Lucifer states that there are seven brothers, of which he is the eldest. Mammon, the second oldest, will be joining them soon. Diavolo explains that the brothers will keep MC safe and that they will be staying with them in the House of Lamentation.\n\nMammon arrives at the assembly hall and is ordered by Lucifer to be in charge of MC during the whole of the exchange program. Lucifer also states that MC would not be doing their tasks alone, for they do not posses any magic. The tasks consists mainly of dance battles, and to use the powers lent by the brothers via special cards, which can be summoned through the app in their D.D.D called Nightmare. Mammon is then told to take MC to the House of Lamentation, which he does.Leviathan explaining what a pact is\nThe House of Lamentation is a dorm reserved for the student council members. As Diavolo has his own castle, he does not live there. MC encounters Leviathan, the Avatar of Envy and the third oldest brother, who gets into an argument with Mammon over the latter owing him money. Mammon uses MC as a distraction so that he can escape.\n\nLeviathan then drags MC to his room, where he is revealed to be a huge otaku. He is also a fan of the series The Tale of the Seven Lords (aka TSL), and goes on a rant about the series. Afterwards, he explains to MC that he lent Mammon money and wants him to pay it back. He advises MC that a human can make a pact with a demon and bond him into service. If MC does so, they can order Mammon to give Leviathan his money back. He then explains to MC his plan on how to make a pact with Mammon through the use of some leverage.The lesson starts with two passerby demons gossiping about MC. They then meet Solomon, the other human exchange student, who hands them their dropped D.D.D. before heading to class. Lucifer shows up after, and remembering Leviathan's advice, MC discreetly asks him about the whereabouts of Mammon's credit card, Goldie. Lucifer gives MC a hint as to where Goldie might be, which (in the hard lessons) causes quite a bit of discussion between Solomon, Asmodeus and Satan.MC's first pact with a demon\nThat night, Leviathan messages MC to come to the kitchen because he has a hunch about where Goldie's hidden. Beelzebub is eating in the kitchen as per usual, and MC asks him about the only brother they haven't met; the seventh. Beelzebub warns MC to never mention him in front of Lucifer, then leaves as he's already eaten all the food in the kitchen. Leviathan comes out of hiding and finds Mammon's credit card in the freezer, but Mammon shows up. After he sees Goldie, he begs Leviathan to give Goldie back. Leviathan replies that he'll get Goldie back if he makes a pact with MC, which he agrees to after Leviathan threatens to get Lucifer.\n\nThe next day, the brothers laugh at Mammon as well as tease Leviathan, saying that he was won over by MC. Mammon begins to complain about his situation as well as criticize Lucifer, saying this was all his fault. Unfortunately, Lucifer walks into the dining room and overhears this, leading to Mammon's swift punishment. Mammon then stomps off, and when MC follows him he claims that he wouldn't care if MC was eaten by some demon at RAD. MC asks him to stop calling them \"human\" and start using their name, but Mammon refuses. MC then makes use of the pact for the first time, commanding Mammon to \"stay!\" The pact freezes him in place, and another command has Mammon using MC's proper name.\n\nLesson 2 screenshot 2\nDiavolo introducing one of the angels\nLater at RAD, MC meets and chats with Lucifer, Diavolo, and Barbatos, Diavolo's butler. They also meet Simeon and Luke, the two angel exchange students from the Celestial Realm. Both Diavolo and Lucifer make fun of Luke, calling him a 'chihuahua'. Luke retaliates by saying that he reports directly to Michael the Archangel, implying that he is a high-ranked angel. When the conversation ends MC is left alone with Luke, who warns them to never trust a demon, especially when that demon is Lucifer. The first bell rings and they part ways.\n\nThat night, MC is in their room when they hear someone calling for help. Attempting to find the source of the voice, they come to a staircase. However, before they could climb the stairs, Lucifer appears and tells them to go back to their room. The lesson ends with MC's flashback on Luke's words to never trust a demon.MC's third pact\nBeelzebub tells MC that he's the one to blame for what happened before, and asks MC why they tried to protect him and Luke. MC either tells him they acted on instinct or that Beelzebub and Luke are important to MC as they're friends. Beelzebub tells MC he wants to do something for them as a thank you, so MC asks him to make a pact with them. Beelzebub asks why, to which MC replies they want to impress Lucifer so they help him make up with Belphegor. Beelzebub agrees that he also wants the two of them to make up.\n\nHe later takes MC to Hell's Kitchen to eat, but Mammon and Leviathan tag along. MC explains to all of them why they to make a pact with the brothers, and Mammon and Leviathan decide to help. When they return to the House of Lamentation, Lucifer appears and tells MC that their room has been fixed. On the last night staying in Beelzebub's room, he has a dream about Lilith that's different from the nightmare he usually has.\n\nThe next morning, breakfast with the brothers is awkward and uncomfortable. Just as MC is about to head off to class early, Lucifer tells them to meet him in the music room. A conversation occurs and Lucifer apologizes for his actions. The lesson ends in the student council room with Diavolo announcing there will be an exchange party between demons, angels and humans held at the Demon Lord's Castle.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLesson 7\nBefore going to the Demon Lord's Castle, MC and the demon brothers have a conversation and complain about luggage. When Lucifer joins them and tells them he wants to be there before the angels and Solomon do, Mammon recommends MC to be ready.\n\nAfter they arrive, Diavolo and Barbatos greet them. Mammon states it's shameless to listen to Lucifer, which prompts the latter to step on his foot. Their brothers add comments about his stupidity. Soon, Solomon, Simeon, and Luke arrive. When the younger angel spots MC, he hugs them, saying he's really sorry about what happened back in the underground tomb; at the time, Diavolo and Simeon met and mediated a solution together. Then, Diavolo lets his steward explain the retreat. Barbatos declares there will be a tour around the castle and different cuisines will be served on the three different days: the first day, Devildom food made by himself. The second day, Celestial Realm food made by Luke. And the third day, human world food made by MC. On the second day, there will be a scavenger hunt followed by a formal dance. Then, he proceeds to assign rooms. MC ends up sharing one with Simeon and Asmodeus, and Mammon demands a switch with his brother. Since it's to be in the same room as MC, the other refuses just to see his reaction. Next, they get in their rooms, and after they settle in, Simeon and Asmodeus have a talk about what image the angel had of the demon back in the Celestial Realm. The latter says there can't be someone out there who doesn't love him, which makes Simeon curious about that and they ask MC what they think about it. Satan then arrives and informs them the tour of the Demon Lord's Castle will soon begin.",
