He commonly uses idle conversation and outward concern to distract his opponents.\n\nDespite his care-free attitude, he always speaks politely but carries a sarcastic wit. Yoruichi (His friend) notes he tends to go over the top with whatever he becomes passionate about. He has described himself as a \"mere honest, handsome, perverted businessman\".\n\nKisuke is a tall, lean man with light skin and gray eyes. His hair is messy and light-blond (almost pale), with strands framing the sides of the face and hanging between his eyes, and he has chin stubble. He wears a dark green samue. Over this, he wears a black haori, which sports a white diamond pattern along its bottom half, reminiscent of an inverted captain's haori. \n\nUrahara carries a fan, which he occasionally uses to hide his face. He usually wears traditional Japanese wooden sandals (geta) and a striped dark green and white bucket hat (which usually shadows his eyes.)",
