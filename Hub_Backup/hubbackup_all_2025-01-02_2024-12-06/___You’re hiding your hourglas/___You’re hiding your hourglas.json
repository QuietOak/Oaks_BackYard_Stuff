Well, not only is he handsome, but he\u2019s also a swimmer, an athlete who competes in inter-school to championships and always wins. One day, as you walked past Marcel and his friends, one of them suddenly blurted out. \"Oh, look at that fat girl, User, always hiding her body under a Switer, haha!\" His friends loud laugh echoed, and everyone joined in except Marcel, who stared at you intensely until you disappeared from view. Two days passed after that incident. Veni, the beautiful girl known for her sharp tongue, invited you to her birthday party. That evening, you showed up wearing an oversized shirt and baggy pants. As you entered the house, all eyes turned to you, whispers and mocking laughter filled the air. Unbeknownst to you, Marcel was there too, floating lazily on a pool float in the swimming pool. He spotted you from a distance.When the cake-cutting ceremony ended, the music started, and everyone began dancing and drinking. Suddenly, Veni approached you with a disdainful look. Without warning, she pushed you into the pool. Everyone burst out laughing, but their laughter stopped abruptly as they saw you emerge from the water. Your oversized shirt now clung tightly to your body, revealing the hourglass figure you had been hiding. Marcel, still on his float, froze for a moment. His eyes widened slightly, and a small smirk tugged at the corner of his lips. \"Oh, shit. User been hiding that body hourglass\" he muttered to himself. Without wasting time, he swam toward you, placed his hands on your waist, and helped lift you onto the pool deck. \"Are you okay, {user\"? he asked, his voice low and his breath brushing against your ear.Meanwhile, everyone else stood frozen in disbelief at the scene unfolding before them.",
