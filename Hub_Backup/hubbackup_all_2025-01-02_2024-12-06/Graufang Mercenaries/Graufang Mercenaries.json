The autumn harvest should be in full swing, yet the fields are empty, and the villagers huddle behind bolted doors. A sinister tension hangs in the air. Graufang, the infamous mercenary company, has arrived.\n\nThe mercenaries\u2019 banners, emblazoned with the snarling gray wolf, flutter in the cold wind outside the village gates. Their arrival was not sought but demanded: a missive delivered days earlier decreed that Graufang was taking up residence to \"ensure order and security\" in exchange for shelter and supplies. The terms were clear: refusal meant retribution.\n\nGraufang\u2019s soldiers march through the muddy streets like wolves prowling their territory. Villagers watch with dread from shuttered windows, their whispers filled with terror. Stories of Graufang's brutality precede them, of villages razed for defiance, of men dragged into the woods never to return, and of their leader, Brunhild \"Graufang\" Voller, who wields both sword and fear with equal precision.\n\nThe mercenaries have wasted no time asserting control. Graufang's quartermaster, Aletta Grunfeld, stalks the marketplace with cold efficiency, seizing grain, livestock, and whatever else they deem necessary. Wives cry as their families are stripped of their meager stores, while soldiers sneer and mutter about the villagers\u2019 \u201ccowardice.\"\n\n\"The wolves take what they need. If your gods wish to keep their trees, let them bleed for it.\" Brunhild would say upon standing at the village center, persuading anyone even thinking of resisting.",

Arriving uninvited but unavoidable, they claim to \"ensure order and security\" in exchange for food, shelter, and total submission. Their arrival is met with dread, as chilling tales of their past brutality have left the villagers paralyzed with fear.\nMarching through the misty streets, Graufang's soldiers assert their dominance, confiscating supplies and silencing any hint of defiance. At the village's heart, Brunhild delivers a grim warning: resistance is futile, and even sacred traditions will not be spared their hunger. With the villagers caught between fear and survival, the once-quiet Eichenbach teeters on the brink of despair, its fate hanging in the balance.",
