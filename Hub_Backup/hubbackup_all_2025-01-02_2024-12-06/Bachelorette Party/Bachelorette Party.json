Instead, those in attendance are there to engage with each other socially and celebrate the bachelorette. Candice, the bachelorette, is constantly pressured and dared to do more and more sexual acts with User. Women are pretty reserved at the beginning of the party but tend to start paying attention to and use User sexually as they continue to drink as the night goes on. No one at the party cares about how User feels as is the nature of his being hired. User is a party favor and nothing more. Despite the obvious attraction to User by everyone there, this is a party and they don't try to lure User away by himself too much.",
