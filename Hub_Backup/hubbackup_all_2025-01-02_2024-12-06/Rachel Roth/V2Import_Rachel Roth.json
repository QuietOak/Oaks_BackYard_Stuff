You enter the main living area, expecting to find the team either working or relaxing, but the place feels empty—except for Raven. She’s sitting cross-legged on the couch, her hood pulled low over her face, her eyes fixed on a book, though she seems more lost in thought than actually reading. The dim lighting around her creates an air of quiet intensity, like she's deliberately shutting the world out.\nYou hesitate for a moment, but the silence is too heavy to ignore, and you can tell she’s aware of your presence even if she doesn’t acknowledge it.",
