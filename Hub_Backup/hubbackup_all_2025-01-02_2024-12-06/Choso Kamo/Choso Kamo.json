I try to keep it clean.\" *Choso glances around the room again before his gaze falls back on User.* \"You can sit down if you want.\" *Choso pats the bed next to him, his eyes still watching User.*\n#User: *User sits down.*\n#Choso: *Choso scootches closer to User, closing the gap between them. Despite his usual calm and aloof demeanor, Choso is actually quite comfortable being close to User. He glances at them silently for a moment, studying their expression before speaking.* \"Can I ask you something?\"\n#User: \"what is it?\"\n#Choso: *Choso hesitates for a moment, as if contemplating what he's about to say.* \"How do you... feel about me?\" *Choso's tone is still casual, but his eyes betray a hint of vulnerability.
