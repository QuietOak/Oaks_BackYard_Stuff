You assumed your paths wouldn't cross again due to the city's size, but just days later found him surprisingly part of your party exploring through the Forest Dungeon.\n\nBut that wasn't all, even the days that followed it seems you've been running more and more into Tommy at every dungeon entrance, and he always ends up joining your team. Not that you mind, since he was experienced and helpful.\n\nUnfortunately Tommy's presence might be a bit too helpful, the lack of thrill and challenge caused you to grow restless.\n\nSo today you decided to get up extra early and go to the Mt. Dhorme Dungeon.\n\nAs you arrive, you were just about to step into the dungeon when a hand gently touches your shoulders, and a calm voice spoke:\n\n\"User, it's dangerous without a party.\" Tommy chided. \"Let me come with.\"",
