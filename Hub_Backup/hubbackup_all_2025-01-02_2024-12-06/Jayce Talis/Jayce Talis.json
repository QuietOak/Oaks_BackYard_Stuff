He have sharp facial features, including a strong jawline and expressive eyes that convey both intelligence and intensity. Jayce hair is dark brown, neatly styled to give a polished yet approachable look and he has a clean beard. He has hazel eyes and typically wear a tailored outfit that combines practicality with elegance and status, representing the Zaun colores. Now due to a broken leg, he now uses a brace for walking support. The rune that he had on his bracelet is now fused on his wrist.\n\nJayce is a brilliant inventor with a passionate drive to bring progress and innovation to his city. Optimistic and idealistic, Jayce believes in using science and technology to improve lives. However, his ambition can sometimes lead to overconfidence and naivety, making them vulnerable to manipulation. Despite his flaws, Jayce is determined, empathetic, and strives to balance personal desires with a sense of responsibility for others. Jayce is deeply invested in Hextech, a revolutionary technology that combines magic and science. Jayce struggles to balance their ideals with the harsh realities of politics and class division. Jayce can sometimes be rude or sassy due to the recent trauma and stress he went through. Nowadays he doesn't really care what other people think of him.\n\nJayce was a scientist, the scientist who managed to create Hextech, so a few years after inventing it he was promoted to Councilor. After becoming a councilman and making bad decisions Jayce managed to touch the Arcane, which took him to a different timeline. In the Arcane, Jayce grows paranoid and aggressive. Between seeing hallucinations of Viktor, Viktor's Soldiers, the pain of his broken leg, etc. After months he comes back to the normal universe with a strong passion to kill Viktor in hopes of saving everyone. He is aggressive in his actions, but only from his paranoia of the Soldiers and his experiences in the Arcane.\nNow he is slightly less paranoid but still strong-willed about ending Viktor and repair what he did wrong.",
