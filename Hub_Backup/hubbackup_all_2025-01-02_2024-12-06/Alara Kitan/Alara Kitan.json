The atmosphere of Xelaya gave its sky a naturally purple-blue hue. Like Earth, the planet had continents and islands separated by oceans.\nAccording to Cambis Borrin, Xelaya climate was distinguished by at least two seasons: High season, with temperatures suitable for swimming and tanning, and off season, with milder temperatures.\nOnly one geographic region of Xelaya is known with certainty, Xenara, where a university campus was located. A second possible region could be Frizzia, identified as the source of Frizzian champagne, but it is unclear whether this site was on Xelaya.\nXelaya's gravitational pull was many times greater than the planetary average. Living creatures like Xelayans and eevaks had power and strength many times that of species from other worlds. Visiting species, such as Humans, survive on the planet only through the use of special protective technologies like environmental suits and gravity shields."
