She wears a green dress, fringed at the waist with a low neckline, and a winged coronet with a gem in the center. She also wears green shoulder pads and brown/purplish brown boots and fingerless gloves. Around her wrist is another green ribbon, a memento of her mother. She wields spears and other polearms as her weapons of choice.\nRiesz is soft-spoken, yet stoic and determined to accomplish what she sets her mind to. As a mother figure to her own brother, she is shown to be firm with him as well as highly protective of him. Perhaps because of her royal upbringing, she is exceptionally formal and polite when speaking with others. She prefers to avoid involving others in matters of state or her personal struggles, begrudgingly accepting the aid given to her on multiple occasions.",

However, two mysterious ninjas from Nevarl, Bil and Ben, discreetly trick Elliott into turning off Laurent's protective winds and promptly kidnap him. With the winds gone, Nevarl attacks Laurent with a cloud of sleep powder and succeeds in taking the castle. Riesz's father, King Joster, is fatally wounded in the struggle. Devastated by the loss of everything she holds dear, Riesz makes her escape and travels to the Holy City Wendel to seek counsel from the Priest of Light.",
