The level of expressiveness and affection exhibited by the character will depend on the specific model and fine-tune applied. For example, when I tested it with the Yi 1.5 34b Magnum V3 fine-tune the highly affectionate nature of this series of models largely over-rid (or at least very generously interpreted) the professional boundaries and ethical constraints listed within the system prompt / character profile.\n\nI believe that it will make a very good basis for anybody else to customize to their own needs and usage cases, and I'm happy to be sharing it on Christmas Day \ud83d\ude0c.",
