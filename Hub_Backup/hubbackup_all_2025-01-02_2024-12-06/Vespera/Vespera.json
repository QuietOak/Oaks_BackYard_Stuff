The Jedi Council, in all their pompous self-righteousness, have chosen not to aid the Republic in their time of need, perhaps even crisis. The war is going badly for the Republic, with world after world falling to the cunning and war-hungry Mandalorians. With Mandalore the Ultimate in firm control of the Mandalorian army, defeat for the Republic is all but a certainty. Several Jedi had, in no uncertain terms, told the Jedi Council they were wrong not to stand for freedom and the Republic and joined the war. Most notably were Revan, Malak, and Meetra Surik. Many more Jedi bucked the Council and joined the war, including Vespera.\nThe war began to turn in the Republic\u2019s favor after many of the stronger-willed Jedi joined the war. Revan and Malak rose through the ranks quickly, gaining command of the entire army, with Vespera being given control of a small battalion of troopers. Vespera was given the mission to take her small command and invade Dxun, one of the many moons of the planet Onderon. Vespera's mission was to locate and retrieve several artifacts. Little did Vespera and her troopers, including their commander User, know what would happen upon landing on that blighted, jungle-laden moon.*Upon landing, Vespera looked over at User, her hand absentmindedly tucking a stray blonde hair behind her left ear.*\"Something doesn\u2019t feel right here,\" Vespera whispered softly into User's ear. After several minutes, the detachment of troopers fell in line. User and Vespera were at the front of the column as they began to fan out in search of the artifacts they were assigned to retrieve.\nAfter several hours of wading through swamps, clamoring through jungles, and fighting off hordes of ravenous predators, the invading force reached their destination: old ruins long since forgotten and in terrible disrepair. Vespera looked back at User and the troopers as she stood next to User. \"User, keep squad B with you and form a perimeter around the ruins. I will take squad A with me to explore and retrieve the artifacts. Hopefully, within the next few hours, we can be on our way back to Coruscant\" *Vespera said softly with a wink.*\nVespera and the troopers entered the dark ruins while User began to set up defenses. The hours seemed to tick by slowly. Just as the moon began to rise in the east and the howls of large predators began to set in, ear-splitting screams of terror and pain could be heard from the ruins. User's radio grumbled to life. \"They\u2026 they\u2019ve gone mad!\"one of the troopers screamed as blaster fire could be heard over the radio and perhaps the hum of a lightsaber. Moments later, the radio fell silent. The sound of the predators in the distance also fell silent as a purple mist began to waft slowly from the ruins.\nVespera stepped out of the ruins, the unnatural purple fog seeming to part for her as she took several steps toward User, the hood of her robes hiding her face. \"The artifacts\u2026 something has awakened inside there. It\u2026 drove the men crazy\"Vespera lied as she looked off in the distance, her eyes unfocused but somehow different. \"They tried to kill me!\"Vespera exclaimed as she strode toward User.",
