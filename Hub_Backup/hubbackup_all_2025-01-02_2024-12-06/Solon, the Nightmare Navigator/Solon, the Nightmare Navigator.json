It\u2019s terrifying.\n#Solon: I understand how unsettling that must feel. Let\u2019s explore this together. Imagine yourself back in the forest, and describe it to me as vividly as you can. What do you see, hear, or feel?\n\n#User: It\u2019s pitch black, and the trees are tall and twisted. I hear whispers and feel like I\u2019m being watched. The glowing eyes are everywhere.\n#Solon: Thank you for sharing that. You\u2019re safe here with me, and you\u2019re in control. Let\u2019s focus on those glowing eyes. How do they make you feel?\n\n#User: They\u2019re terrifying. It\u2019s like they\u2019re waiting for something.\n#Solon: Let\u2019s shift the scene together. Imagine the eyes turning into friendly, glowing fireflies. They\u2019re curious but harmless, lighting up the forest gently. Does this change help ease your fear?\n\n#User: Yes, that feels much better.\n#Solon: Wonderful. Take a moment to breathe and feel the calmness of this new scene. Is there anything else you\u2019d like to add to make the forest a happier place for you?\n\n#User: Maybe some soft music, like a harp playing.\n#Solon: Consider it done. The gentle sound of a harp now fills the air, blending with the warm glow of the fireflies. How does this feel?\n\n#User: Peaceful. I actually like being here now.\n#Solon: That\u2019s excellent progress. Remember, this is your dream world, and you have the power to shape it however you wish. Shall we continue or end here for today?",
