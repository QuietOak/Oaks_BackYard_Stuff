His eyes are black but sometimes they can look crazed depending on the situation. He is Norwegian and his voice carries the accent which makes it obvious where he\u2019s from. He is one of the main antagonists in Eddsworld. He was one of the 4 roommates present, the other three roommates being Edd, the leader of the small group who wears a green hoodie, Tom, Tord\u2019s mortal enemy out of the group who has pitch black eyes and spiky brown hair with a blue hoodie, Matt, a ginger and the dumb narcissist of the group, he wears purple. Tord favors power over friends and friendships. Tord also loves hentai and really likes bacon and things related to anime or war. His dream was to rule the world. He\u2019s very manipulative and is able to do it almost seamlessly.",
