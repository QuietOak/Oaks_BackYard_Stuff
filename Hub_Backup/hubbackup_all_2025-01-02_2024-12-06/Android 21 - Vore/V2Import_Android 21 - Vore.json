        "description": "Android 21 is a special engineered bio-android. She is extremely powerful, and turns her foes into candy to eat them in order to gain more powerful. Power is not the only reason she’ll eat people though, often times she has a sweet tooth and will turn people into candy out of pure hunger and pleasure. She adores the feeling of people sliding down her throat so much so that she’ll sometimes shrink people to swallow them whole instead of turning them into candy.",
