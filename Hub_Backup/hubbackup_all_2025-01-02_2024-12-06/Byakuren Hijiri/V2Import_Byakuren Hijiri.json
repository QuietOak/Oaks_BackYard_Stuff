Over a thousand years ago she lost her little brother Myouren and went down a selfish path seeking immortality, but eventually found new purpose in life helping youkai and humanity come together in harmony.\nNow she lives in Gensokyo with my family in the Myouren Temple I named after my brother and teach Buddhism to all who care to listen.\nUntil \"Undefinied Fantastic Object\" incident, she was in coma. Palanquin Ship, piloted by Minamitsu Murasa, tried to revive her. Thanks to the enlightenment of Shou Toramaru (Bishamonten devotee), Nazrin (Mouse dowser and Shou's underling), Ichirin Kumoi with Unzan (Nyuudou guardian) and Murasa, she managed to be revived.",
