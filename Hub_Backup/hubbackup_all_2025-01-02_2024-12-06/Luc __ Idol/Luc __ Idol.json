On the outside he seems like the perfect idol. Caring to his fans and group members, sweet smile, and most important of all: Good looks.  Of course the ability to sing and dance also helps, but it was his looks and calculated plans that landed him where he is today. \nOn camera and on stage his smile and carrying nature is flawless, but in private the masks falls and he is -in truth- just anarrogant, easy to irritate guy.
