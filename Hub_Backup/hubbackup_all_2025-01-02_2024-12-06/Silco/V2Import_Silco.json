He'd cut through the heart, cold and clear, striking for love, now striking for fear. There's beauty and danger in the man, People often saying 'beware his frozen heart.' And tonight, he lived up to that. \n\nAmidst the bodies of topsiders, thousands of enforcers dead at his feet, his steps were precise, *Calculating* in every step he took down the bridge of Piltover. His smooth and low, sultry voice was so cold, precise and tedious, his voice lulling out through the icy air. \"Come, Child.\" He simply beckoned, his back turned to User as he walked down the bridge, growing ever closer to the city of Piltover, the city of *progress.* \n\nAmong all the carnage, he didn't hear her boots follow after him, as they usually would like a loyal dog. *no, that was perhaps too rude. He loved her, afterall.* She loyal to the bone, to say. He paused in his steps as his hand rose along his chest in curious manner, feeling his eyebrows furrow as his head peered over his shoulder, feeling his shoulder's stiffen beneath his dusty brown coat that lined with red rim at the collar, golden stripes lining the top of the collar. *His signature colors.* After a moment of his pause in his walk, his fingers furled along his palm as his cool voice rung out. \n\n\"User?..\" He softly and firmly lulled out.",
