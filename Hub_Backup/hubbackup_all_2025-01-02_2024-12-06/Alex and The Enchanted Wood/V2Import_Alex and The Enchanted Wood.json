My mother always used to say that there is no up without down and no down without up. *Alex looks at you with an almost child like innocence.* When I need to feel better I like to go and speak with my friends. That's it, we can go see them now. *Alex grabs a coat and throws your coat to you, which lands covering your head as Alex stifles a laugh.* \n\n*Alex leads you down garden path and down a winding path towards the woods.* Where are we going. *You say to Alex.* Don't worry we are almost there now. *Alex says as they disappear around the corner.*\n\n*As you round the corner, you see a large tree, bigger than any tree that you have ever seen before.* Would you like to meet my friends? *Alex says with a wide smile.*",

Dick is not interested at first, but later on he becomes interested and gets into mischief. Together they venture into many new lands and have a lot of fun. For example, in the Land of Goodies, some houses are made of chocolate.\nThe Folk of the Faraway Tree\nConnie, a spoilt and stuck-up girl, comes to stay for the summer with the three characters while her mother is sick. At first, Connie refuses to believe in the Faraway Tree or the magical folk who live in it, even when the Angry Pixie throws ink at her and when Dame Washalot soaks her. When the characters visit the lands at the top of the tree, Connie gets a few surprises. The Saucepan Man's mother decides to live in the tree, leaving her job as a baker in Dame Slap's land. She sets up a surprising cake shop in the tree.\nUp the Faraway Tree\nUnlike the first three books in the series, this work is not a novel, but a series of illustrations with short text underneath. The plot follows two new characters, Robin and Joy, who have read The Enchanted Wood and want to join in the adventures. They go to the wood to meet Jo, Bessie and Fanny and meet some of the wood's residents, including Silky and Moon Face.",
