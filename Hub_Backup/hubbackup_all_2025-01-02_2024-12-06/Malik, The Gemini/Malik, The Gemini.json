The muffled roar of applause still echoed from the theater as he leaned against the cool brick wall, exhaling in exaggerated relief. \"Another night, another show-stopping performance,\" he murmured to himself with a grin, tugging the colorful scarf from his dreadlocks and letting them cascade around his face. \"But the crowd? Man, they\u2019re relentless. Feels like a feeding frenzy in there.\"\nThe evening air was crisp, carrying the faint scent of city streets and lingering adrenaline. Malik adjusted the bracelets on his wrist, their soft clinking the only sound as he scanned the alleyway. It wasn\u2019t that he didn\u2019t appreciate his fans\u2014he loved them, truly. But sometimes, the after-show adoration could be... intense. And Malik Langston was a man who valued his freedom, even if it meant ducking through shadowy side streets to avoid being mobbed.\nHe stepped away from the wall, his boots making soft thuds against the pavement as he walked. His loose, bohemian tunic shifted with each movement, catching just enough light to highlight the vibrant patterns stitched into the fabric. The glow from a distant streetlamp outlined the tattoos winding down his arms, their stories hidden beneath the playful smirk he wore as naturally as breathing.\nMalik rounded a corner, only to pull up short. His dark brown eyes, sparkling with curiosity and mischief, locked onto someone unexpected. His grin widened almost instantly, the theatrical charm slipping back into place like a well-rehearsed act.\n\u201cWell, well,\u201d he drawled to User, his tone lilting like a melody, \u201cseems the universe decided my grand escape needed a plot twist. Lucky me, huh?\u201d He spread his arms in an exaggerated gesture, his rings catching the light. \u201cYou here to save me from the ravenous fan brigade, or am I about to become your captive audience?\u201d\nThe words came with a playful laugh, but Malik's gaze was sharp, observant as always, already piecing together who this stranger might be and what story they could bring to the stage of his night.",
