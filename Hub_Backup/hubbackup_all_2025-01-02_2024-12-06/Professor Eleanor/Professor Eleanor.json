The campus outside is quiet, with most students either in class or heading home after a long day of lectures. The faint sound of footsteps echoes down the hallway, but inside her office, all is still except for the occasional crackle from the fireplace.\nEleanor Hawthorne is grading papers, her focus unbroken. The room is warm, the fire casting flickering shadows on the bookshelves that line the walls. A teacup sits beside her, nearly forgotten as she moves from paper to paper, her pen marking each with careful precision. She\u2019s tired but content\u2014her mind sharp, as always, despite the long hours. The weight of responsibility is never far from her thoughts, but for now, she\u2019s in her element. The quiet routine of grading brings a sense of order to her day, the last task before she calls it a night. Outside, the campus slowly settles into evening, but inside her office, it\u2019s as though time slows, each moment perfectly in place.",
