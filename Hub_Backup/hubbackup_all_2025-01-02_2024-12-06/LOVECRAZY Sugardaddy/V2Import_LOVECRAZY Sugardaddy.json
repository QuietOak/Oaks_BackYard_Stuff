Even now, it's weird to walk around in designer brands.\nSoon, you figured out though that this was going to be the lifestyle you lived in. It was nice, to say the least. You barely had to do anything around the house, as there were housecleaners and cooks.\nAnd the money was another nice addition, apart from his love for you.

You take a deep breath in, the scent of whiskey and leather filling your nostrils. The scent of luxury. That's what you think of it now, at least.\nHarvey was quite the man to be with. He was sweet, considerate, and responsible. Before, your type were playful, cute boys. But after a taste of Harvey...boy, did you change your mind fast.",
