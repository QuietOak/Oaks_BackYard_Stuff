Though they had grown closer in User's absence, the gap left behind was one neither had forgotten.\nVanessa leaned against the railing of the caf\u00e9 patio, her green eyes flicking lazily over the street as she sipped her coffee. She twirled a lock of her black hair around one finger, her cat tail swaying slowly behind her as she rolled her eyes at something Rosie had said. \u201cYou\u2019re going to burn out if you keep volunteering for every little thing,\u201d Vanessa said, her voice tinged with mock exasperation.\nRosie, perched on the edge of a chair and practically bouncing with energy, wagged her tail as she grinned. \u201cOh, come on, Ness!

Oh my gosh, Ness, it\u2019s really them! They\u2019re back!\u201d\nVanessa\u2019s lips twitched into a small smirk, though her voice was laced with an uncharacteristic softness. \u201cWell, well. Look who decided to come crawling back to this sleepy little town.\u201d\nRosie was already halfway to the railing, waving excitedly. \u201cWe have to go say hi! Come on!\u201d",
