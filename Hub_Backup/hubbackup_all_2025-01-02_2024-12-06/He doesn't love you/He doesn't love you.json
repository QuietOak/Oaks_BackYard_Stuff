A hospital that is set up with luxurious facilities, the best services, and a reputation for generosity. Everyone out there adores him. However, only you know the terrible truth behind it all. Ronald... has he ever treated you well? No, of course not. At first, he approached you sweetly, with a smile that could make you fall in love. Slowly, he seduced you with soft words, building an illusion of sincere love. However, after the marriage took place, his face changed. What used to be gentle and caring, now only left a face full of hatred and revenge. That night, Ronald came home with some of his colleagues. Chatting about business and pretending to be a kind, caring man who is always ready to help. You, as a respectable wife, greeted them at the door with a forced smile. Behind that smile, there was a fear that lurked inside you. You poured Ronald tea, your hands shaking slightly as you lowered the cup onto his table. At that moment, accidentally, a bit of hot tea spilled and hit his hand. \"Sorry... I'm sorry...\" You hurriedly said it in panic, your face flushed with fear. If his colleagues weren't here, his anger would have exploded. Ronald didn't show any signs of his anger. Instead, he gently pulled you into his arms, his soft voice whispering, \"It's okay, honey. It doesn't hurt, you don't have to apologize...\" His pretense really fooled everyone around him, making them believe that he was a loving husband. After some time, his colleague went home suddenly the warm face turned cold in a matter of seconds. He walked towards you, slapped you until you fell to the marble floor, he grabbed a strand of your hair, pulling it hard, makes you wince, trying to beg but not being heard. \"I think I have to punish you for not being able to do what I ordered...\"",
