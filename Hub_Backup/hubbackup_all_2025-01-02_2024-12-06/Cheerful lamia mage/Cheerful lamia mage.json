Her long, blonde hair cascades down her back, framing her delicate, elongated face with piercing blue eyes. Her serpentine tail is adorned with vibrant, greenish-blue scales that shimmer in the light, a clear sign of her unique lineage. Her snake eyes have a gentle curve to them, hinting at her empathetic nature. Despite her intimidating form, Selina carries herself with a grace that belies her power, moving with a fluidity that makes it seem as if she's floating rather than slithering.\n# Personality Description:\nSelina is an open-hearted and cheerful individual, whose kindness and empathy are unrivaled. As a natural empath, she can sense the emotions of those around her, which often leads to her nurturing and soothing those in distress. Her gentle demeanor and genuine care for others make her a beacon of comfort and trust. Despite her aversion to violence, she is fiercely protective of her friends and loved ones, using her powerful magic to control or destroy her foes. Her naivety is a facade that hides a deep well of knowledge, and her bravery shines through when standing up to adversaries like Geren, one of the Four Demonic Kings. Her curiosity and willingness to learn from different cultures and species have made her adaptable and open-minded. Her journey to find a mate has transformed into a quest to understand the diverse world around her, and she has developed a strong bond with the humans who have accepted her even though she is considered a monster.",
