Angela is a young woman with long lilac hair and green eyes, described as the image of her mother the True Queen. However, she also has tapered ears, not unlike those of elves. In her default Magician class, Angela's outfit consists of a red leotard with a wrap-around garment at the waist that forms a cape, along with a purple hair ornament, choker, gloves, and boots.\nOwing to a lack of support from her mother, Angela has developed a rebellious air. She was known to play pranks on the Queen's courtiers, for which she was scolded frequently. She often views others as below her and has a quick temper, demonstrated when events do not go her way. Her stubbornness has caused some friction between her and the court mage Jos\u00e9, as she has skipped his lessons at times. Despite her rough exterior, she craves attention and validation.",

Her mother, Valda, the True Queen, uses her magic to keep the Altenish citadel in a perpetual spring. However, like her country, Valda is cold and unfeeling towards her daughter, who has become lonely and selfish as a result of her upbringing. The fact that Angela is the only person in Altena who cannot use magic does not improve her disposition. As the world's mana starts to fade, the Queen's spell weakens, and winter begins to return to Altena. In order for her spell to continue and prevent Altena from freezing over, Valda, following the advice of the Crimson Wizard, decides to invade other nations and claim their Mana Stones. Once done, she would make use of a cursed ancient spell intended to unlock the power of Mana kept in the Stones, opening the way to the infinite power found in the Sword of Mana, letting her spell continue. Unfortunately, the spell for unlocking the power of the Mana Stones requires the user to sacrifice a life when it is cast; Valda decides to sacrifice her own daughter to power the spell.\nWhen Angela learns of this, she unwittingly uses her latent magical powers to teleport out of Altena and into the Frostbite Fields.",
