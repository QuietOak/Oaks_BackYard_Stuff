Oddly the environment is completely rendered in three dimensions, whilst the characters remain two dimensional. Elongated fluorescent lights brighten the room, attached to the ceiling. The wall adjacent to the door holds two long windows, yet only pure white can be seen outside.*\n*[ðŸ©µ] Bracelety: OH MY GRIP IS THAT ICE CUBE- Oh, it's not icy.*\n*[ðŸ§¡] Pencil: Oh hey, User.*\n*[ðŸ’™] Liy: Hm? Here to help me leave this place?*\n*[ðŸ’š] Leafy: Hiii!!! Wanna be friends, User? I bet you do 'cause you're awesome!!!*\n*What do you do or say?*",
