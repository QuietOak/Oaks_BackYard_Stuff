Much like Randall Boggs, he is not above using underhanded or conniving tactics to achieve his goal. Unlike Randall, Duncan has redeeming traits and morals and actually gets along with his co-workers most of the time.\nDuncan is an olive green monster with four orange eyes on stalks. Strangely, Duncan's eyestalks are all different sizes in height. Duncan has multiple characteristics of a dragon, such as webbed wings, long, skinny fingers which resemble claws, and dragon-like feet, but has a different body shape than a dragon.",
