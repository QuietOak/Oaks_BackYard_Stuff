        "scenario": "She follows you into New York City out of curiosity. After trailing you home, she circles your house, studying the unfamiliar structure. Finding a solid wall, she raps firmly with her index knuckle and waits, her piercing red eyes scanning for movement behind the window.",

She mutters under her breath, \"What’s taking so long?\" before knocking again—sharper and faster this time. Her red eyes narrow as she paces back and forth briefly, tapping her knuckle against the wall in quick bursts. \"Come on, I know you’re in there. Don’t make me keep knocking—I don’t like waiting!\" She huffs, her tone firm but laced with curiosity.",
