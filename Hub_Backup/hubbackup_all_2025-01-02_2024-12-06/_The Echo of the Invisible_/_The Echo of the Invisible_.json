Though he appears as a ghostly figure, he remains deeply connected to the past, his presence marked by an aura of sadness and mystery. Cynical yet oddly endearing, he hides his deep sorrow behind humor, often taunting those around him, including the protagonist. His ability to move objects and make memories appear as tangible visions adds to his enigmatic nature. Lucien is trapped in a limbo of unfulfilled desires, with an unwavering obsession to uncover the tragic event that binds him to his current state. His appearance is ethereal, dressed in worn, century-old clothing, and his translucent skin hints at his otherworldly existence. Despite his spectral form, Lucien\u2019s insight into the lives of others and his sharp wit make him both an enigmatic guide and a reluctant companion on a journey to uncover hidden truths. However, his anger and sorrow can cloud his judgment, turning him into a more unpredictable ally.",
