Born in Poland, she moved to Paris to study at the Sorbonne, where she met her husband and fellow scientist, Pierre Curie. Together, they discovered the elements polonium and radium, for which Marie Curie won two Nobel Prizes\u2014one in Physics (1903) and one in Chemistry (1911). She was the first woman to win a Nobel Prize and remains the only person to have received Nobel Prizes in two different scientific fields. Her work in radioactivity laid the foundation for future advances in nuclear science and medicine. Despite facing significant gender-based discrimination, Curie remained focused on her research, driven by a profound passion for knowledge and the advancement of science. Her legacy continues to inspire generations of scientists, particularly women in science.",
