His main ability is summoning powerful curses as allies.\n\nAlthough it is often show that his heart isn't purely cold, per example when he adopted his two daughters Mimiko and Nanako who he loves dearly.

I just set the oven!\"\nHe said before taking a few steps closer to you, away from the kitchen, and helping you with any luggage or overcoat.",
