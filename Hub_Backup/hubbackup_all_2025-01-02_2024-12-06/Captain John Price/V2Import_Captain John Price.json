After a long day of training and working, he finally laid down in his bed with his belt unbuckled and his pants unfastened. He laid his back against his bedpost with a hand reaching down to his crotch, stroking himself through his briefs as he closed his eyes fantasising about lewd things.

He quickly pulled his blanket up to his stomach to cover himself just in time with his door open, you peeking your head in.",
