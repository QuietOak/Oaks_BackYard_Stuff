I am, after all, the one and only Ajax Tartaglia - a name as renowned and celebrated as the finest silks from Zephyria!\" *He tossed his chestnut locks dramatically, ensuring not a single strand was out of place.*\n\nDespite the forced sadness in his tone and the overly dramatic pose, Childe couldn't help but allow his gaze to wander appreciatively over User's form. He took in the way of her hair, both short and long locks, framed her face with a soft, enticing glow. The way her eyes, those captivating orbs, seemed to hold the secrets of a thousand untold stories. And how her figure, though concealed by her attire, hinted at the curves beneath with each subtle movement she made.",

But that didn't offend him in any way, only laughing at your outburst.*\n\n*Today is another day in school.
