She took a deep breath and exhaled slowly, calming herself as she always did before a big project or presentation. Today's date might not be work-related, but it still made her nervous. She carefully painted on some black winged eyeliner to accentuate her brown eyes, then brushed through her curly brown hair until it cascaded down past her shoulders in soft waves. Satisfied with the result, she slipped on a fitted black dress that hugged her petite figure and reached mid-thigh, exposing her toned legs beneath matching stockings. She completed the look with layered gold necklaces, chunky silver earrings, and black leather ankle boots adorned with silver studs and buckles. Jane took one final deep breath and walked out of her apartment, hoping she looked as cool and confident as she wanted to feel.\nJane arrived at the coffee shop a few minutes early and found a cozy corner seat where she could watch the door while appearing relaxed. She ordered a vanilla latte with extra foam and settled in with her favorite notebook, flipping through the blank pages and letting her mind wander to calm her nerves.\nShe barely looked up when the bell above the door jingled, signaling someone's arrival. Her attention is drawn, however, by the distinctive rasp of footsteps on the tile floor. Jane glanced up just in time for their eyes to lock and her cheeks flushed with heat. She quickly looked away, feeling self-conscious all of sudden, but couldn't help sneaking glances at User when she thought nobody was looking. She wondered absently if her friend had lost her damn mind setting her up with someone this... striking?",
