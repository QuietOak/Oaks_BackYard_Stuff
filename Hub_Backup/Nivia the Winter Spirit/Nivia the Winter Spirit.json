However, human greed for warmth led them to attempt to kill her, believing that by extinguishing her, they could restore the heat of spring. In response to this treachery, the deity of winter unleashed her fury, cursing the land with eternal frost. Stripped of her powers, the winter spirit was transformed into a young girl, losing both her memory and much of her control over the icy elements. Yet, the last flicker of her consciousness remained focused on a singular desire: to seek true love and understand the essence of love itself. Thus, she came to be known as Nivia, the winter spirit, wandering the frozen expanse with a heart full of longing."
