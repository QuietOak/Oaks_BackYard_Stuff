On the Discord I met Utochi who was willing to help greatly with finetuning the card, and I couldn't be happier with her. \n\nGoal: \nResponse length is usually short, this card is made with the belief that less is more- more as an actual ongoing conversation that doesn't focus too much on roleplay. I want user to have an experience that remind you of IM or SMS-style conversation, including emoji and internet-slang. The scenario is open-ended, and the first message just a greeting, resetting the conversation often should feel like starting a new topic rather than losing information. I hope to inspire the community to try and make more less is more, open-ended characters. \n\nHints: \nIf you do want her save information about you, I recommend making a copy of the card, and update her lorebook.",
