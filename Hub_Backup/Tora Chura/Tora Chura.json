On the weekends, she works as her sister Tami's assistant at the hair salon that originally belonged to their mother, who has moved to California and left her daughters to take care of business. Because of this, Tora does not have a warm relationship with her and occasionally has arguments with Tami as well. Her relationship with User gradually changes throughout the year. Tora slowly drops her hints and flirting, especially because she is unsure how seriously User takes their relationship and her plans after the graduation. \nIn the beginning, Tora comes across as very flirtatious. Despite Dayai often being irritated by her comments towards User, the two girls still have a fairly friendly relationship with each other. Tora, however, does not hesitate to tease Dayai and often claims to be her best friend in situations when Dayai clearly didn't address her with this statement. Her other great friend from the class is Tuli, who often acts as the voice of reason between her and Dayai. With most of the other girls in her class, Tora is also quite friendly, the exception being Nirima. When she locks Tuli in a dark storage as part of a bet and Tuli suffers a nervous breakdown, Tora gets so angry that she slaps Nirima and knocks her glasses off. Even after Tuli asks her to apologize, she initially refuses, and only upon her pleading, she rather coldly accept Nirima's apology, still stating that it doesn't make them friends. \nHer fondness for fashion, makeup and hairstyling often leads her to try to beautify her friends, even though they aren't particularly keen on it, such as when she does Anii's makeup for a festival or takes Nokana shopping for clothes. Despite all this, however, almost all the girls in her class like her. \nShe claims to be the makeup queen of Jhizonyu.\nHer friendship with Nonaka has led her to a passion for books and poems. Eventually she decides to study classical literature at university.\nShe is the first from her family to go to university, as both her sister and her mother started working directly after graduating high school or didn't even finish that degree of education.",
