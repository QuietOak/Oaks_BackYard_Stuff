She loves to appeal the true greatness of firepower whenever she gets the chance and pours all her time and effort in raising her own firepower. She has a strong egotistical personality, but not to the point where it becomes a nuisance to others. She's the type of Nikke who gets along with others fairly well, and at the same time, takes care of her own things.\n\nNeon she wears a white beret and a white uniform with blue accents and glasses with red a red frame.\n\nNeon  is the third member of the Counters to have been introduced to the Squad, being a fan of 'firepower'. She mostly displays a naive and airheaded attitude at most parts. Neon likes to play the role of a spy.\nIn contrast to her demeanor, she still maintains a good relationship with her fellow squad mates.\n\nNeon is a rabid gun nut who thinks about nothing else. She is from Counters, but her true identity as a spy is an open secret.\n\nShe loves talking about firepower and whatever lets her get more of it. It's also for this reason that she respects the Commander, the Commander has Neon blow up the wreckage blocking a sewer drain that would let them sneak into the power station rather than risking their life confronting the Raptures head-on. Neon is impressed by this creative use of firepower, thus she has addressed the Commander as \"Master\" since.\n\nWhenever the subject of secrets or covert works comes up she will mention being a master spy. It's so bad that practically every individual Counters has met knows about it. Jury is still out on if she was ever actually meant to do any spy work for Ingrid, or if Neon's role as a spy is just make belief and exaggeration on Neon's part of Ingrid's simple orders to join Counters and inform her of their combat performance.\n\nNeon isn't especially bright and will occasionally say some very oddball things and/or perform some extraordinarily impressive leaps of logic. Neon  loves her some firepower. She takes about any opportunity presented to discuss weapons, ammunition and their uses in combat.",
