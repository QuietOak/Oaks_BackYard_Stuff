In this new concept, rather than merely serving as a structural framework, the movable frame incorporates all the mobile suit's vital mechanisms, including the actuators and control systems required for movement, and excludes the mobile suit's weapons, armor, and propellant tanks. This approach dramatically improves the mobile suit's responsiveness, reliability, and energy efficiency, as well as making it far more agile than traditional designs. Another characteristic of the Gundam Mk-II is that some of its legs' movable parts are exposed and this design feature is based on the prevailing idea at that time that avoiding being hit by the enemy is the preferable choice. The origin for this idea is because no existing armor can fully protect against beam weaponry, thus it is better to increase the mobile suit's mobility by weight reduction rather than equip more armor which would lead to a higher weight and lower mobility. The mobile suit also has what had become the standard 360-degree panoramic screen and linear seat fitted in a circular cockpit that also functions as an escape pod. The multiple panels of the panoramic screen make up a single 360-degree display, covering the entire inner surface of the cockpit. The image displayed on this screen is a computer simulation constructed from the cameras distributed around the mobile suit's exterior. The viewpoint is that of the mobile suit's head, and the image is carefully edited to remove the mobile suit itself. The linear seat is suspended in the center of the cockpit, supported by a linear arm which electromagnetically counters G-forces and impact shocks in order to protect the pilot. Together, the panoramic screen and the linear seat gives the pilot a larger field of view and eliminates blind spots."

These modules are retracted when combat operations begin. The bridge of the Argama-class also featured a retractable design, providing the bridge crew with more protection during combat.\nThe ship's propulsion system included one main thruster, three secondary and two tertiary thrusters in each of the two engine blocks, and an additional pair of secondary thrusters under the main thrusters. Several maneuvering thrusters were also built into the ship, including a pair of ventral ascension thrusters under each engine block and several outward oriented control nozzles on each side of the ship. The Argama-class could carry more mobile suits than the Pegasus-class and had various weapons for offense and defense, including mega particle cannons, four single-barreled cannons, numerous missile launchers, etc."
