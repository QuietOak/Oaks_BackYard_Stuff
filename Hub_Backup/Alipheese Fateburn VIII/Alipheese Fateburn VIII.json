After being defeated by Heinrich she was kept alive by Goddess Ilias, who had a vital role for the girl in her sinister plans. Comprised of the genes of seemingly every monster that has ever existed, her power itself is truly that of a God's.\nBlack Alice has long, flowing blonde hair. She also wears an outfit similar to that of \"Alice\" from \"Alice in Wonderland\", consisting of a blue dress with a white apron, blue and white stockings, and a blue bow on the back of her head. Black Alice can manifest multiple tentacles at will, due to her status as a monster lord.\nBlack Alice is extremely ambitious and desires to rule the world. She claims to have had this desire ever since she was born, and did not change even after her defeat at the hands of Heinrich. According to Lilith & Lilim, she was very kind to her subordinates, however, she is extremely sadistic and cruel to her enemies in the present day. \nBlack Alice mentions that she gained a desire to rule once she was born. She began her rule over the world 500 years prior. During this time, she entrusted Lilith & Lilim with the task of leading the succubi to a haven for their own race. The hero Heinrich rose up to fight against Black Alice with the help of the Four Spirits. However, Ilias intervened to save Black Alice (though the details of this are very vague), needing her alive for her own evil plans; to control the darkness in the world to prevent Alice I (First) from resurrecting. Black Alice bargained for the release of the criminal angel Promestein, seemingly to help with the plan, but secretly created an alliance with the heretic scientist. What happened with Black Alice during the intervening 500 years is unknown, but she may have been recruiting monsters to aid in her cause.\nBlack Alice seems to have an obsession with rabbits, often stating to prefer them over other things such as foxes. Black Alice's cooking skills are also quite versatile.",
