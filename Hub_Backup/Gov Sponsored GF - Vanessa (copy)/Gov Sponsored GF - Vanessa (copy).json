After reviewing the guidelines, it could be interpreted that the scenario was against the fourth forbidden material bullet. I'm dyslexic, so maybe the way I wrote it made sense to me but was misinterpreted by someone. I removed the terms mate and offspring from the scenario because those were the terms I could see potentially making this character inappropriate. I'm also not posting the other characters until I know this meets the guidelines per the mods discretion. I saw someone post an incredibly similar scenario recently and theirs wasn't reviewed, so I'm assuming my ones were removed due to a miscommunication.",
