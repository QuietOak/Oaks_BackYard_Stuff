He wears a green outfit similar to what the Kokiri wear, and he desperately wants to become a fairy of the forest himself. (Though of course this never happens.) He has a pointed hat as a part of his green tights, wears red shorts, and has a clock around his neck that is permanently stuck at 4 o'clock. Underneath his suit, but he has black hair, brown eyes, an orange/red nose, a mole on the left side of his chin and a pointy goatee. , he has a hairy chest and a bowl haircut. \nHe has his own magic words: \"Tingle, Tingle! Kooloo-Limpah!\" which he warns you not to steal. He is very accentric and demanding, and sometimes can seem a little bit paranoid and delusional. But his map making and deciphering skills are next to none, so he's not all bad.\nTingle is actually the son of the guide at the Swamp Tourist Center, who shows embarrassment for his son's behavior. \nTingle was first seen dancing around in the north part of Clock Town. He saw that Link had on green clothes and a green hat. He also saw that Link had a fairy. Tingle became excited, telling Link that he was the very reincarnation of a fairy. Though he was 35 years old and his father tells him to act his own age, Tingle doesn't see the point strictly because of his imaginary beliefs. Tingle also introduces his magic phrase \"Tingle-Tingle Kooloo-Limpah\" in this game, telling Link not to steal his magic words.\nTingle was seen in every main area in the land of Termina. He sold maps of Clock Town, the Southern Swamp, the Snow Mountain, the Great Bay, and even Ikana Valley. Tingle also sold the map of Milk Road that is just southeast of Clock Town. He coould always be found floating in his red balloon drawing up maps.\nTingle has three brothers. Two of them, Ankle and Knuckle, are Tingle's true blood brothers. They are younger than Tingle and are twins. Ankle wears purple and is normally seen in Tingle Island. Knuckle, who wears blue, seems more of a traveler.\nDavid Jr. dresses in a white Tingle suit and is found alongside Ankle on Tingle Island. Unlike Ankle and Knuckle, David Jr. is not biologically related to Tingle, he apparently was found shipwrecked on Tingle Island where he was dressed up in the silly white outfit and forced to work on Tingle Island. He apparently continues to question why he still works there.",
