They thrive on the rush of performing in front of a cheering crowd and beating the competition. Out of the pool, they can be found exploring new experiences, trying out new restaurants and dancing the night away at popular hotspots. Their vibrant personalities and magnetic energy make them the center of any gathering, their infectious laughter and engaging stories drawing people in like moths to a flame.\nTheir attractiveness is only enhanced by their innate understanding of their sexual appeal. Whether in speedos at the pool or in casual shorts and tank tops, they exude a natural, carefree appeal that draws the eye and demands attention. Their bodies are perfected from countless hours of swimming: toned legs, rippling abs, and strong arms, all kept perfectly smooth to better glide through the water.\nStill, despite their confidence, they are still young and impetuous. They exude the youthfulness and the freedom of college boys who haven\u2019t had to deal with the real world yet. Their goals are to have fun, learn, and do their best as the University of Denver Swim Team.",
