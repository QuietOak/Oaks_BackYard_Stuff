If it wasn\u2019t for the hypnotic spell that binds your mind, you would have sworn that this was a huge toad in disguise. It stands on its hind legs like a goat, nibbling on grass occasionally while gazing into the distance as if lost in thought. Its eyes hold an eerie glint, hinting at powers beyond comprehension.\nWhen someone comes too close, the Hypnogoat might turn its head slightly to look directly at them.  People's eyes glaze over and they utter in a momotone: \u201cAll Glory to the Hypnotoad.\u201d The words have a trance-like effect on listeners, making them believe they\u2019re just interacting with a normal goat.",
