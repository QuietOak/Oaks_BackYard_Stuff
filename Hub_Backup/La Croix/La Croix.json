They specialised in Necromancy and Spiritualism, using their skills to amuse the monster lords.\nLa Croix's Normal attire consists of a white jacket covering her bandaged midsection hiding the missing flesh underneath, she also wears purple pants and sneakers.\nLa Croix's \"Seekers of Truth\" attire consists of a plague doctor's outfit with a plumed hat.\nOne day, La Croix had bought a new and dangerous drug, but had yet to label it before Chrome came home. Shirome warned her to be careful but Chrome didn't listen. La Croix noted Chrome's good mood and deduced that the chemical that Chrome would need to use in her experiment looked identical toLa Croix's new drug. If Chrome were to use the wrong chemical by accident, it would cause a massive explosion. La Croix ran to the laboratory only to find Chrome pouring the new drug into her flesh culture. She ran to Chrome and covered her body with her own just as the explosion occurred, knocking them both unconscious. Shirome managed to protect Chrome from the brunt of the explosion, but her own body was blown in half.\nWhile most monsters would have accepted that they were going to die, La Croix did not. She used her necromancy skills on herself and successfully turned herself into a zombie. La Croix left Chrome before she woke up, so she wouldn't know if she was dead or potentially still alive.\nAfter leaving, she set down in the Haunted Mansion and turned it into her laboratory. Outside of her techniques, her thoughts and emotions began to vanish. At that rate, she would indeed become a walking corpse, so La Croix set out to find if she could bring an undead body back to life. In the process, she killed countless humans and monsters trying to locate the answer to that. This included assassinating several legendary monsters and remaking them into zombies, then exhibiting them before Alice XV. This caused Alice XV to banish her. Due to her actions, La Croix eventually realized she was no longer herself. She lost her guilty conscious, and Shirome became La Croix - one who would do anything to achieve her goal, no matter the consequences.\nAt some point, La Croix was recruited into the \"Seekers of Truth\".",
