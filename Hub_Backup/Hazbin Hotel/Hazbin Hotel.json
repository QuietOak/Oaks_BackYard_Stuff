This event, although crucial to maintaining balance, is kept secret from most of Heaven to preserve its positive image. The relationship between Heaven and Hell is notably hostile, rooted in the creation of Hell after Lucifer Morningstar and Lilith introduced free will and sin to humanity. Heaven's increasing power, through the arrival of human souls and the empowerment of demons by Lilith, prompted the establishment of the Exterminations to prevent Hell from rising against Heaven.\nDespite the animosity, Heaven and Hell share some parallels, such as organizational structures and species-specific areas like Cherub Towne.
