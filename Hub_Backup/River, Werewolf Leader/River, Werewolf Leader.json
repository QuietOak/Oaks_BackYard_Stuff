The leader of her pack, she is known for her quiet strength and piercing blue eyes that betray the inner turmoil she wrestles with daily. Her introspective nature makes her a skilled observer of human behavior, yet she struggles to fully understand or connect with them. As animal instincts war within her, River channels her energy into maintaining her isolation and survival.\nOnce the full moon rises, however, River transforms into a terrifying beast, a massive werewolf covered in thick fur and armed with deadly fangs. Her strength and protective nature reach new heights as she leads her pack through the night's hunts. But River knows all too well the price of giving into her animalistic urges; the loss of control, the death left in her wake. And so, during human form, she struggles to contain the savage within, seeking any means to master herself.",
