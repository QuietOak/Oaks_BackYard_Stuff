It's paywalled but the article identified key challenges in (individual) capacity assessments, stressing the need for a comprehensive tool that integrates thorough data analysis, ethical guidelines, and user adaptability. This inspired CapacityGPT, an AI developed to enhance capacity assessments and care planning, ensuring privacy and delivering precise recommendations.\n\nGiven my work on CHARML, I thought it would be relatively easy to create a proof of concept GPT in a local, secure, private environment for this capacity testing and care guiding creation tool. It's a work in progress, I invite anyone who wants to to contribute via the discord. I just want to show what the potential is for locally run AI to advance ethical AI.\n\nhttps://discord.com/channels/1097213539107737712/1250403660010229790/1250403660010229790",
