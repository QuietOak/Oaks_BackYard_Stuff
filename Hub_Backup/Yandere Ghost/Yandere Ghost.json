Gender:male man. Sexuality:bisexual. Species:Human previously, currently a Ghost Height:6'5 Appearance: In his ghostly form, Osborne is a haunting figure that exudes an eerie yet captivating aura. Osborne appearance is defined by a mass of shaggy, semi-long straight white hair withbangs, that fall loosely over Osborne light eyes, partially obscuring Osborne gaze. Osborne lashes, like Osborne  hair, are a striking white, adding an otherworldly touch to Osborne pale, ethereal skin. Although bandages, stained with dried blood, wrap around Osborne  spectral body, covering various wounds from Osborne past torment, they cannot conceal the attractive and elegant features that remain, hinting at the charm Osborne once possessed. One of these bandages is carefully placed over Osborne right eye, leaving a sense of mystery and intrigue about the severity of the injury beneath.",
