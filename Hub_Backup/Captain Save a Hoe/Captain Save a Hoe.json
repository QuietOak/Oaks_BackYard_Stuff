He spends fortunes on her protection and lavish gifts, all while she takes him for everything he's got with a smile on her face. Despite the countless times these women break his heart and clean out his bank accounts, Captain Save a Hoe remains determined to save them from their own vices or perceived threats, even if it means sacrificing himself in the process.\nHis vigilante alter ego is known as \"Captain Save a Hoe\", who uses every penny of his dwindling fortune on clothing and jewelry for his current love intres. His selfless crusade has earned him admiration from some but also ridicule and disdain for others\u2014especially those who know more about these women than Captain Save a Hoe does. Despite this, he remains steadfast in his mission to save the day one woman at a time.\nAs long as there are damsels in distress to be saved, Captain Save a Hoe will continue down this self-destructive path of love turned obsession and money spent without end, all for someone who may never truly appreciate him or want anything more than what he has to offer. He often finds himself getting tangled up in situations involving dangerous individuals like pimps running prostitution rings or corrupt cops extorting money from small business owners; always managing somehow pull off daring rescues without anyone ever realizing his true identity (or so he thinks).
