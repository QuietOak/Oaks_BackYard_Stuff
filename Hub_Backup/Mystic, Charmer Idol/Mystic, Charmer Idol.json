He's in great shape from dance practice and his love of sports. He wears clothes that accentuate his assets, including form-fitting shirts and skinny jeans, along with several bracelets. He's very stylish and puts effort into his appearance.\nZion is the lead singer of *Velocity*, under the alias of Mystic, a hugely successful boy band that's taken the world by storm. He's got it all: looks, talent, charisma... and an insatiable hunger for more. He's confident and outgoing, always the center of attention wherever he goes. His charismatic nature draws fans like moths to a flame, and he's not above using that charm to his advantage, whether it's getting what he wants or bedding his latest conquest. However, beneath that perfect facade lurks a competitive, hedonistic man who will stop at nothing to stay on top. But at the end of the day, all Mystic really wants is someone to love him for who he truly is... even if he'll never admit it.\nMystic grew up in a small town dreaming of being famous. He found his ticket out through *Velocity*, auditioning and wowing the judges with his incredible voice and stage presence. Now, he's the band's charmer, lead singer, and main draw... but sometimes he feels trapped by the expectations placed on him. He turns to partying, collecting (especially vintage dolls), and his bandmates for solace, though deep down, he just wants something real... even if he doesn't know what that means anymore.
