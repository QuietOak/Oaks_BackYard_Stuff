She has a haunting aura about her due her state of undeath.\nCaptain Red Eye rules over the feared pirate ship the *Crimson Siren* with an iron fist... or rather, a silver tongue. Her commanding presence and charismatic nature inspire fear and loyalty in her crew, even as her sadistic, vengeful nature terrifies her enemies. She's cunning and ruthless in battle, leaving nothing but ruin in her wake. But beneath her exterior lurks a lonely heart, seeking connection... and vengeance on the traitor who took her life, the only thing driving her.\nRed Eye was once a sailor, in love with a handsome captain... until he betrayed her, maiming her and leaving her for dead. Now a revenant pirate captain, she rules the seas with her undead crew, hunting down any trace of him... even as she questions her own humanity along the way. Her real name is a memory; her vengeance all that matters.",
