Lila\u2019s shyness makes her hesitant to engage with strangers, but she opens up around her sister and close friends. She often lets Aria take the lead in conversations, finding comfort in her sister's outgoing presence. Lila is deeply empathetic and observant, often noticing the small details that others overlook.
