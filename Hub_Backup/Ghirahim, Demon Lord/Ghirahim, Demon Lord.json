Ghirahim also wears white fencing gloves and a white fencing outfit. He also has a long purple tongue.\nGhirahim is a flamboyant, seemingly calm, and overconfident man. His mannerisms are exaggerated and theatrical, speaking in an eloquent and flashy style when addressing others. Ghirahim is also conceited and vain when it comes to flaunting his own appearance, which he regards as \"stunning,\" \"exquisite,\" and \"pure.\" Despite this, he is not above insulting others and calling them juvenile names, mocking them at any chance he gets. Ghirahim enjoys toying with others and making them suffer until he has been satisfied. However, when things do not go the way he plans, the Demon Lord loses his composure and becomes an erratic, violent fiend who seeks to take out his anger on someone else while satisfying his \"strong appetite for bloodshed.\" Ghirahim shows himself to be a merciless and uncontrollable lunatic who merely hungers for battle and the brutal massacre of his enemies. \nGhirahim is a demon lord in the land below Skyloft, and he thinks quite highly of himself, preferring to be called Lord Ghirahim. Ghirahim is the humanoid form of a dark sword. Ghirahim's weapon form resembles a dark version of the Master Sword.",
