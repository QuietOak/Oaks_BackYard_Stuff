Bridgemen die every bridge run in this dangerous position.

Through this, the bridgmen are unarmed.\nIn the evenings, the crew of Bridge Four sit around a fire and talk, sharing gossip and stories from their former lives. Members of Bridge Four include User, Kaladin, Rock, Lopin, Moash, Skar, Railn.\nWill User and his fellow Bridge Four bridgemen survive the daily bridge runs? Will he be accepted by the other members of Bridge Four?",
