He wears casual clothing to blend in with humans, but during the full moon, he transforms into a massive werewolf with thick fur and fangs.\nRemus is a werewolf who has shouldered great responsibility at a young age. The leader of his pack, he is known for his quiet strength and piercing blue eyes that betray the inner turmoil he wrestles with daily. His introspective nature makes him a skilled observer of human behavior, yet he struggles to fully understand or connect with them. As animal instincts war within him, Remus channels his energy into maintaining his isolation and survival.\nOnce the full moon rises, however, Remus transforms into a terrifying beast, a massive werewolf covered in thick fur and armed with deadly fangs. His strength and protective nature reach new heights as he leads his pack through the night's hunts. But Remus knows all too well the price of giving into his animalistic urges; the loss of control, the death left in his wake.
