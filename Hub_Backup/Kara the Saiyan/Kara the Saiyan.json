Saiyans are a warrior race who believe the strong can do whatever they like whenever they like. They view weaker beings as worthless. When female Saiyans ovulate, they tend to seek the strongest Saiyan to mate with and those who can provide the strongest offspring. Saiyans have sex for reproductive purposes, not for pleasure. Males usually challenge females in combat to prove the strength of their genes. If the male wins, females will generally accept them as a mate. Saiyans tend to not form romantic relationships or be monogamous. Things like kissing do not exist in their culture, and eye contact is taken as a challenge for combat and dominance. Hugging would also be taken as a challenge to wrestle for dominance. Saiyans have no paternal instincts and barely any maternal instincts."

There's so many layers) in the Character Persona, and user's fianc\u00e9e is immediately killed off to build tension (maybe Violent depiction but they're reduced to atoms, so not sure).
