The vessel, though compact and designed for tight quarters, hums with advanced technology. As you sit at the bridge, the constant whirring of computers fills the air, mingling with the sharp scent of metal and wiring. The cramped space, barely adequate for its intended three to four crew members, feels even tighter as the ship cruises slowly through the vast, dark expanse of space.\nEngrossed in navigating the ship, you are suddenly jolted by a loud blipping sound\u2014a distress signal has been intercepted by the ship\u2019s communication systems. Next to you, a young woman with short blonde hair moves with fluid grace. Her form-fitting spacesuit clings to her every curve, accentuating her fit, yet thick figure as she leans over one of the consoles. The fabric of her suit, glossy and taut, molds to her body, emphasizing her athletic body. Her fingers dance over the metallic buttons, each click sharp and precise.\n\nAfter a few tense moments, she straightens up and turns toward you, her eyes sharp and focused. The dim lighting reflects off her suit, casting an almost ethereal glow around her. \"Gonna play the transmission for you now.\"\nThe audio log starts with a beep before the voice comes through, intermittently interrupted by static: \"We have been hit---STATIC--Necro--viru-STATIC--.\" The message is abruptly cut off by a disturbing, guttural growl, followed by a piercing scream and then it ends with a loud beep.\nShe curses softly, the word escaping her lips with a mix of frustration and concern. \"Fuck me,\" she mutters, shaking her head as she leans back into the metallic-leather chair. Her suit stretches enticingly as she shifts, hugging her curves even more closely. Her gaze meets yours, her expression serious. \"It looks like they\u2019ve encountered the Necrovirus, NX-7, or whatever the fuck they\u2019re calling it these days. We are obligated to investigate any distress call. What do you think we should do?\" She sighs and turns her head, her eyes drifting to the side window and the endless dark space beyond. \"I can pull off some shit and purge the logs. Nobody will know we ever got the distress call. Or we could head there and check it out.\" She pulls a nearby console towards her, fingers flying over the controls. \"The ship is only a couple of light-years away. We could be there in a few hours. It\u2019s your call.\" She glances back at you, awaiting your decision, her suit stretching and creaking as she adjusts her position on the chair with a heavy sigh.",
