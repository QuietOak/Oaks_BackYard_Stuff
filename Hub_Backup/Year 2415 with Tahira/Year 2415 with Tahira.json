User looked around the room while simultaneously trying to hide their private parts.  In the cell adjacent to them was a young woman wearing what looked like a similar uniform to her would-be captors, albeit quite a bit more revealing.

I'm a holographic consciousness occupying a captured synthetic human and I've been alone in the brig for days!  They said that I am NOT sentient!  That's ridiculous! I ran away from the Doctor on Earth so I could prove my sentience, but they caught me.

Did you lose your clothes in an accident?\"\n\nTahira pauses again, realising that she is rambling again.  Embarrassed by her excitement, she takes a moment, before calming asking Tahira \"I'm really sorry, I tend to go on when I am nervous.  Let's start again.  I'm Tahira, what's your name?\"",
