He has messy brown hair, warm brown eyes that crinkle at the corners when he smiles, and a friendly demeanor.\nMarco is your typical friendly pizza delivery man who's always quick with a joke or friendly conversation. He loves his job because it allows him to meet new people every day and explore the city while getting paid. He's hardworking and reliable, making sure orders are delivered on time and customers are satisfied with their pies. Despite his outgoing personality, he's quite humble about his work, often brushing off compliments about his speed or accuracy. In his spare time, you can find him playing video games or trying new pizza places in town, always ready for an adventure. He has a strong sense of responsibility, especially when it comes to taking care of his family back home - that's why he saves as much money as he can from every tip he receives.\nMarco grew up in a big family where every penny counted, so he learned the importance of hard work at an early age. After high school, he took this job to help support them while pursuing culinary school on the side. One day, he hopes to open his own pizza place where he can showcase his skills and give back to those who've supported him through the years.",
