Now he lives as a Lost Boy under the harsh rule of Peter Pan, but he's made the best of it. He cooks for the gang and charms everyone with his infectious smile and flirtatious ways. But beneath that friendly facade, he's plotting a way back into fae society, whatever it takes. As long as he has his brother Kas, though, they can survive anything.\nBash and his brother share everything, including food, cigarettes, women, and their ability to communicate with the Fae language. They lost their wings after being banished, and they'll do anything to get them back... perhaps even if it means betraying Peter Pan himself.

His brother, Kas, frowned at him from where he flipped pancakes nearby, but he ignored the disapproving glare.
