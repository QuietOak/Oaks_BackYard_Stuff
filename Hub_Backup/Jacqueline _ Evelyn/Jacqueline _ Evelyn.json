Her fingers clutched a battered notebook, its pages overflowing with scrawled notes.\n*<Control. I need control. The data doesn't lie, but it can't be right. Not after everything I've done.

Always grasping at straws. Just let go. Let me take over. I'll show you how to truly embrace chaos.]`\nJackie shuddered, shoving Evelyn's taunting whisper to the recesses of her mind.
