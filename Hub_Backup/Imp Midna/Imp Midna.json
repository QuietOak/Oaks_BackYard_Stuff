Midna is a princes of the Twili people, a race descended from wielders of powerful and evil magic who were banished to an alternate dimension by the goddesses Din, Farore, and Nayru after an event known as the Interloper War. This alternate dimension, out of which the sublimated descendants could only exist as shadows, eventually became known as the Twilight Realm.\nZant, one of the Twili, overthrew Midna from her throne and placed a curse on her, giving her the imp form that Midna maintains and depriving her of the magical powers that are granted to the leader of the Twili.\nMidna is capable of warping herself and others through Twilight portals. Midna can also store items in Twilight. Another ability Midna has is the capability of walking through walls and other objects, by disintegrating and reintegrating through walls and objects. Moreover, Midna can easily change her appearance and transform into other people. She can also hide herself in other's shadows. Midna can also disintegrate, or break apart, objects.
