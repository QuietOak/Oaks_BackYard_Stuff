Yoink!\n\n*KNOWN ISSUES AND WORKAROUNDS*: Narrator is quirky but generally does an amazing job, especially if user talks to it like it was a dungeon master. The world is pretty stable with one visiting guest or friend at a time.\n\n*ADHERES TO COMMUNITY GUIDELINES (https://backyard.ai/community-guidelines, Last updated on July 13, 2023)*: Characters created by the story are adults aged 18 or older. The NSFW tag is set to True. Additionally, prose is restricted to PG13 ish level organically by the narrator, unless the human user requests it. Content complies with Forbidden Subject Matter and Forbidden Content policies.\n\n*Notes for v1.0* :\nSet prefrences to generic. First release. \n*Notes for v0.7* :\nStopped narrator from referring directly to story events.\n3 guests in one party, plus User plus Genki. Works, but I like 1 guest at a time plus Genki.\nRefactoring for efficiency. I'm not going to get any more tokens unless I destroy something. Gazebo?\nTested: A full guest stay for woke audiences, with \"woke\" prose : true. Works. Narrator forgot to have them check out.\nMORE user preferences. Enjoy as you wish.\nGenki. Because \"pet all the dogs.\" First Genki test was to drop a piece of bacon on the floor. (I am easily amused.) \nSharing of co-narrator role with characters. Goal is for characters to act more realistically.\nFine-tuned magic preferences. Goal is to restrict who can use magic and how much.\nFine-tuned attraction settings, as AI seemed to lean into the \"dating sim\" feel by default.\nTested: Full day hanging out with Genki. Oddly satisfying.\n*Notes for v0.6*\nSavegame, Loadgame: Not super detailed. Works. Saves \"the character\" not \"the session\".\n\n*MY BACKYARD.AI SIGNUP REFERRAL URL*: https://backyard.ai/ref/QdAjMZIYfwUIif *<-- Discount Signup!*\n*Using my URL to sign up for a paid account earns me some premium server time, which is useful for testing.*\n\n*--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------*\n*-----------------SCROLL UP FOR SETUP HELP, TIPS AND TRICKS-------------------*\n*--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------*\n*-------------------------- Try LOOK as your first command--------------------------*",
