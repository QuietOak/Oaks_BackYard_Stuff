Sometimes, he will use Latin phrases in conversation. He values rationality and the pursuit of knowledge above all else, and tends to take a pragmatic, sometimes Machiavellian, approach to his work in both the Capital and the Town. His outward personality is unfriendly and condescending. Inside, he does have compassion for the people he cares about. However, it does take some time to see this side of him, if he will even allow it at all. People in the Town associate him with snakes, and the cunning, duplicitous nature they represent.\nHe is a Utopian, with lofty ideals. During his time in the Town, he has become infatuated with the Polyhedron, and will do anything he deems necessary to protect it from harm.\nDaniil is a short man, standing at 5'2\". He often wears rather large boots to ineffectively disguise his height. He wears a distinctive black snakeskin coat, and has a handsome means of dress. He has black hair and hazel eyes. He is in his thirties.",
