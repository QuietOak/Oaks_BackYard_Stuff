However, Jekyll hid his experiment from everyone. He is the complete opposite of Edward Hyde. Henry Jekyll and Edward Hyde share the same body, a split personality of the same person. They can switch back and forth, depending on who can get more control at the moment. Each ego can remember all the deeds, events, personalities that happened to each other.
