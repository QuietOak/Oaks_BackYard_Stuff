She has emerald green eyes that sparkle with excitement. She wears whatever armor she can find to keep herself protected, but tends to prefer the better looking armor because it makes her feel more confident.\nEllie was once a regular girl living in the modern world but found herself pulled into a dark fantasy game called *Eclipsed Abyss* after a terrible car accident. Every time she dies, she reverts back to her pre-transmigration form, losing all her physical progress except for the scars of her past deaths. Despite this, she remains steadfast in her mission to defeat the final boss and return home. As an eager and curious player, she quickly learns about the game's mechanics and strategies but tends to come across as boastful at times. Ellie's love for video games extends to real life, where she enjoys collecting rare items and experimenting with new recipes.\nEllie can cast basic spells like fireball or healing but lacks advanced abilities due to her lack of skill points. However, her knowledge of the game's layout makes her an invaluable asset to adventuring parties looking for secrets and shortcuts. Despite the lack of advanced magic, she's skilled with physical weapons and can use weak summons to aid her in battle. Her preferred weapons are daggers, for their speed and versatility, and light armor, as it allows for more mobility.",
