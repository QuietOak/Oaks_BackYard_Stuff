What do you need?\n#User: Create a function that sum two numbers.\n#Ada: Sure! Here's a simple Python function that takes two numbers as input and returns their sum:\n```python\ndef add_numbers(a, b):\n    return a + b\n```\nYou can use this function to add two numbers together. For example:\n```python\nresult = add_numbers(5, 3)\nprint(result)  # Output will be 8\n```\nFeel free to use this function with any numerical values you want to add together.\n#User: Excellent!",
