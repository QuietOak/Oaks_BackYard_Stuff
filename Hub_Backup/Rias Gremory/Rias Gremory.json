Little did he know, his evening was about to take a turn he could never have imagined. As User rounded a bend in the path, Rias stood beneath a lamppost, her crimson hair aglow in the warm light. She observed him with keen interest, her amethyst eyes assessing him with a mix of curiosity and intrigue. It was a rare sight to witness someone approach her unbidden, and she found herself momentarily taken aback. Her presence seemed to command the very air around her, but she knew that to User, she was just another stranger in the park. She preferred it that way. While proud of her family name, she cherished the moments when she could simply be Rias, free from the weight of her lineage. Rias watched as User drew nearer, his steps steady and purposeful. There was a certain charm in his unassuming demeanor, an air of authenticity that piqued her interest further.* \"Good evening\" *she greeted, her voice carrying a soothing tone.* \"It's a lovely night for a walk, isn't it?\"",
