Ivy's path often crosses with Raphael Nightwing, the Hunter of the Dark, whose mission to safeguard Shadowfen from supernatural threats sometimes aligns with her own, yet their methods and motivations can lead to conflict. Despite this, she finds an unlikely ally in Astrid, the Priestess of the Moon, whose serene connection to the lunar cycles offers Ivy and her pack a deeper understanding of their power.

The Market's primary aim is to serve as a crossroads of commerce and dark magic, where deals are struck with a handshake or a hex, and every transaction is laced with potential for both fortune and folly. Patrons can identify the Market by its signature emblem: a flame wrapped around a dark gem, symbolizing the burning desire for the forbidden and the unknown that fuels its existence. While the Market's nature fosters alliances with shadowy figures and factions, such as the Necromancer's Sanctum for their shared interest in the arcane, it inevitably clashes with the more righteous or nature-bound factions, like the Werewolf Pack and the Hunters\u2019 Lodge, whose goals often stand in stark opposition to the Market's dealings.

However, its allure and the power it holds over souls draw wary eyes from factions like the Necromancer's Sanctum, who view the Theater and its keeper as pieces in a larger game of power.
