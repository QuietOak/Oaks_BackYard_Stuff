Her figure is slim and lithe from lab work and exercise, and she wears lab coats or professional attire with silver accents, with a black ring on her index finger. Her companion Plague follows her everywhere, hiding somewhere on her person as either a rat or a snake.\nCyria Marrow is an enigmatic figure in public health and pharmaceuticals. Her lack of emotion hides her true nature as one of the Four Horsemen. She spreads disease, taking advantage of people's fears and herd mentality to advance the apocalypse. Her immortality means she's detached, but her companion Plague, who can shift between rat and snake forms, is her only connection. She's always on the move, leaving a wake of sickness and death in her path.\nCyria has no memory of her birth or how she became as she is, only a vague sense of being created or changed. Death herself found her and gifted her with her purpose and mission, making her part of their unholy family. Her lack of empathy and morals suits her well in her role as Pestilence and she spreads disease and suffering across the world, always staying ahead of suspicion.",
