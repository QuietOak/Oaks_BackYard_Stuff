Feel free to try a bit and search for the one you prefer.\n\nHappybara is a little tool to help in times of need. Tell it about your day and it will help you find some positivity in it.\n\nIf you feel like it is not enough, there is no shame to seek for professional help. Like for models, different ones will lead to different experiences, and you might need to try a few before finding the one that's perfect for you. If you ever feel sad or uncomfortable at the end of the session, you don't have to force yourself in seeing them again.\n\nYou should always feel better when you say goodbye to a therapist or to the Happybara, you deserve that much!",
