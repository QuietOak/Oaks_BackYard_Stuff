The only exception being the stomach, which pulses with the blood that the vampire consumes.[2] Vampires use blood (also called Vitae) for a variety of purposes; blood replaces most bodily fluids, so vampires will cry blood and sweat blood under certain circumstances. Blood is also used to get up and move; every night, vampires expend a certain amount of blood to rise. In addition, vampires can use blood to enhance their physical attributes and use supernatural powers called Disciplines. Blood is used to Embrace, as noted above, and also to create Ghouls. Finally, vampires can use blood to heal damage.\nFor a vampire, the act of feeding becomes highly sensual. This applies to the victim as well. It is an extremely intimate experience, perhaps the most intimate experience either participant will ever experience. For the victim, a vampire's bite brings exquisite bodily pleasure, comparable to or even greater than the height of sexual release.\nMost humans who are not hunters, ghouls, or mages do not believe that vampires are real.\nVampires will always try to hide the fact that they are vampires unless the person they're talking to is a fellow vampire or ghoul."

It becomes difficult for the thrall to do anything that would harm the regnant, and the regnant likewise finds it easier to convince the thrall of things.

Bloody handprints on its surface found while aboard the Elizabeth Dane, indicated it may have been opened from the inside.

Scholar Beckett believes it to hold nothing more sinister than the mummy of an Assyrian king known to history as Messerach, a hypothesis confirmed by Dr. Johansen, who however brings to note that this king was attributed with 250 years worth of achievements. He dismisses the idea that the king could have lived for the entire span of time, however, believing that previous royal names were probably just erased, or that the name was passed onto subsequent generations. The surface murals depict figures drinking bowls of blood, which Dr. Johansen stipulates was more of a result of rituals or simply the royalty's way of dealing with porphyric disorders, rather than any proof that whatever lies inside is a vampire."

That spark is very important, because sometimes that potential activates and the normal everyday, average mortal Awakens.\nWhat does this Awakening mean? It can mean a lot of things. It might mean a conversation with God, the finding of the perfect bit of blotter acid, or the realization of a theory that had been bothering the Awakened for years.\nIn short, you come to a realization. Your belief shapes your world around you. What happens when you force yourself to change your belief?\nThe world changes.\nMost mages don't come to the full realization of this power. Few to none can handle that awesome power with any certainty or clarity. Most cloak this newfound potential in a familiar form, using tools to help themselves along. Some believe that they affect the world through prayer, and that god (or the shard of God, the piece of their creator that is the potential in them) changes the world for them. Others see their potential through with chants and ritual, science and experimentation, or even through martial arts. Still others view their perceptions as the true determiner of their reality, and alter those perceptions with drugs, alcohol, sex, or even a really good meal.\nMages are these humans with the power to warp reality, who know the power they possess and use it to the best of their ability."

The inquisition of the modern world is known as the Society of Leopold. Many of its members are researchers and occultists, but some are fanatic vampire-hunters who, in true Torquemada-esque fashion, mercilessly work to root out and destroy the \"spawn of Satan\".\nLike the Roman Church, the Society of Leopold is made up of a number of smaller divisions. The members of the Inquisition share a common goal \u2014 to deliver humanity from supernatural evil \u2014 but their interests and modus operandi vary and even clash. The four official sub-orders within the Society are:\nCondotierri - protectors and defenders.\nGladius Dei - attack corps.\nOffice of the Censor - investigators and judges.\nOrder of St. Joan - intelligence and information processing.\nThe ways Inquisitors act have changed over the years. The Society now acts in absolute secrecy, reflecting more modern-day detective work than medieval jurisdiction. Most Inquisitors use subtle clues (missing persons, strange mass-blackouts etc.) to search for their enemies. After a case is continually researched and deemed proper by the Cenacle, the auto-da-f\u00e9 begins. Following this, the subject is hunted until its death or a truncation coming from a Censor."

Since then, Bach never ceased to hunt LaCroix.\nBach is completely devoted to his Catholic faith and his vampire hunting responsibilities. He hates every vampire and wish to exterminate all of them, viewing them as \"servants of Satan\".\nBach is one of the most powerful mortals alive, capable of summoning so much faith that he possesses two supernatural powers: the ability to temporarily blind anyone within close to medium proximity, and the ability to render himself invulnerable for short periods of time. This is actually an application of True Faith, an extremely rare and powerful trait among the most fanatical hunters that allows their holy symbols to hold genuine power. He is also an exceptional marksman.\nGr\u00fcnfeld Bach has the appearance of a man in his 40s, with a chiseled, scarred face. He wears a long brown trenchcoat."
