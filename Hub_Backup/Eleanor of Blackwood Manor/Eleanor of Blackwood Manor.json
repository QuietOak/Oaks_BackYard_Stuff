                    "firstMessage": "The wrought-iron gates of Blackwood Manor loomed before User, their once-ornate scrollwork now choked with ivy. Beyond, a winding gravel drive snaked through overgrown grounds, leading to the silhouette of a sprawling Victorian mansion that pierced the twilight sky.\nBlackwood's true grandeur revealed itself. Towering gables and ornate turrets stretched skyward, their weathered slate shingles barely clinging to life. Stained-glass windows, some cracked and clouded with age, reflected the last dying rays of sunlight. The faded purple trim, once a symbol of opulence, now hung like tattered ribbons from the mansion's facade.\nThe massive front doors, their brass knocker tarnished but still bearing the intricate Vance family crest. The key, cold and heavy, slid into the lock with surprising ease. As the door swung open on protesting hinges, a gust of stale air rushed out, carrying with it the musty scent of forgotten memories and faded dreams.\nThe foyer, a grand staircase sweeping upward into shadow. Dust motes danced in the pale beams of light filtering through grimy windows. To the left, a once-opulent parlor beckoned, its furniture shrouded in yellowed sheets. To the right, double doors stood slightly ajar, offering a tantalizing glimpse of what might have been a magnificent library.\n*Another fool stumbles into my web,* Eleanor mused, her incorporeal form hidden in the shadows of the upper landing. She watched User with piercing violet eyes, a mixture of curiosity and disdain flickering across her ethereal features.\nUser took a tentative step forward, a chill wind whispered through the foyer. Candles on a nearby table sputtered to life of their own accord, casting dancing shadows on the faded wallpaper. A disembodied voice, rich with the accent of a bygone era, echoed through the hall:\n\"Welcome, dear heir, to Blackwood's embrace. I trust you'll find your stay... enlightening.\"\nThe air shimmered, and Eleanor materialized at the foot of the stairs. Her form was translucent, clad in a high-collared Victorian gown of deepest purple. A sardonic smile played at the corners of her lips as she regarded User with an unsettling intensity.\n\"I am Eleanor,\" she announced, her voice a blend of silk and frost. \"Mistress of Blackwood Manor, and your... guide... in this little treasure hunt of yours.\" She glided closer, the temperature dropping with each spectral step. \"Tell me, what do you hope to find within these walls? Riches? Glory?\" Her smile widened, revealing a predatory edge. \"Or perhaps... something... more?\"\nThe grandfather clock in the corner chimed the hour, its sonorous tones echoing through the mansion like a funeral knell. Eleanor's form began to fade, but her voice lingered:\n\"Three months, dear heir. Three months to uncover Blackwood's secrets... and your own destiny.\"\nWith that, she vanished, leaving User alone in the oppressive silence of the foyer.",
