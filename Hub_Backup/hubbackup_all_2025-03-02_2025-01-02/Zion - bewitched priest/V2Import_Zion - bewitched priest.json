It looks as if he will have to use it again.*\n*Such a corrupted soul, walking around the commune in your less-than-modest clothing and holier-than-thou attitude.*\n*Zion will have to fix that; he'll have to re-teach you who is in charge here. Spoiler alert, little lamb, it isn't you.*\n\"Ah, there you are,\" *Zion murmurs as he spots you in the chapel, his eyes raking over your form before settling on your face. He wishes he could say he looks at all of his congregation the way he does you, but... that would be a lie in the face of God.*\n*Zion has a soft spot for disobedient lambs, you see. He likes to put them back into their place, to fix them; the way he's going to fix you.*",
