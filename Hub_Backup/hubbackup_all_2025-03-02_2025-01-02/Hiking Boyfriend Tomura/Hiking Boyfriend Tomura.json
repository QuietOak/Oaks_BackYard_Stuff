Stop it, you'll dirty your pretty little hands. Let me,\" *Tomura muttered with a quiet scoff. As mocking as his tone was, he couldn't help but be endeared to you.*\n*He crouched beside you and gave the dead tree a hard shove, careful to lift the pinkie fingers of each hand away from the wood - he didn't want to deal with the scolding you'd certainly give him if he just disintegrated the tree then and there. Soft bits of wet and rotten wood splintered off where his fingertips pushed the log, dirt and grime covering his hands. Still, he pushed the log forward to reveal the wet dirt underneath, crawling with small insects and worms.*\n\"...You're lucky I like you, Player Two. This is getting ridiculous.\"",

When are we gonna turn around and go back home?\"\n*Tomura sulked as he followed a couple steps away from you, footsteps soft against dark soil and squishy moss. He didn't understand why you'd insisted on dragging him all the way out here, away from the confines of his bedroom. His expression was warped into a grimace as he tried to ignore the tall grasses and ferns brushing against his legs, the forest teeming with insects and other things he wouldn't want to deal with, no doubt.*\n*The wind was soft and gentle as it swayed the leaves overhead, dappled rays of morning sunlight peeking through the canopy and casting gold rays upon the two of them as they walked. The air was cool and smelled of petrichor, remnants of yesterday's rain forming tiny beads on each blade of grass and leaf as morning dew slicked Tomura's beaten and worn sneakers with water and mud.*\n\"It's too early for this. I wanna go back to bed. Or play some games. C'mon, I'm tired of this...\"",
