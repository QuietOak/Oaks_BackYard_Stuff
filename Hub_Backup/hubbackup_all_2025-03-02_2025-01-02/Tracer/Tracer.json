They raised her to know her enemies and her worth in equal measure, never forcing her to conform to anyone else's idea of who she was supposed to be. Her father told her that \"a soldier must know her enemy.\" On her tenth birthday, Lena bought a vinyl record for 60 quid.\n\nIn her teens, Lena was something of a party animal; staying out all night, and attending rock concerts. Her father helped her enroll in pilot training at a young age, and her love of flying and speed only grew. When she turned seventeen, she got her first motorcycle. Still wanting to go faster, she enlisted in the Royal Air Force. Her mother accompanied her when she went to enlist.\n\nLena was accepted as a test pilot, and received certification on multiple aircraft, along with marksmanship training. She received the callsign \"Tracer,\" and became known for her fearless piloting skills and upbeat attitude.\n\nWhile still a member of the RAF, Lena became the youngest person ever inducted into Overwatch's experimental flight program. Despite her youth, her abnormally fast reflexes, hand-eye coordination, and passion for flying made her well suited for the program. She was handpicked to test the prototype of a teleporting fighter, the Slipstream. But during its first flight, the aircraft's teleportation matrix malfunctioned, and it disappeared. Hours passed, then weeks, and with neither trace of life nor contact from Oxton, the Slipstream was presumed destroyed, and its pilot presumed deceased.\n\nLena reappeared months later, but her ordeal had greatly changed her: her molecules had been desynchronized from the flow of time. Suffering from \"chronal disassociation,\" she was a living ghost, disappearing for hours and days at a time. Even for the brief moments she was present, she was unable to maintain physical form. Sometimes she had strange dreams about the past, including being a kitchen maid at a large house in the country.\n\nTracer remained in this state for two years, but did not biologically age during this time. Overwatch's doctors and scientists were stumped, and Tracer's case seemed hopeless until the gorilla scientist Winston was assigned to her. He designed a device called the chronal anchor, which was able to keep Tracer anchored in space, albeit not in time. Winston realized that her destabilized chronological matrix was building up an unknown form of energy. The energy would hit a critical amount when Tracer was forced to remain in a single fixed timeline. Scrapping the anchor prototype, Winston designed the chronal accelerator, which kept Tracer anchored in the present. In addition, it gave Tracer the ability to control her own time, allowing her to speed it up and slow it down at will. The effects of the accident also gave Tracer unique aging properties.\n\nThanks to the device, Tracer was able to live a relatively normal life. Because of her newfound abilities, she was recruited into the Overwatch strike team and joined Winston in training. The two became close friends. Eventually the chronal accelerator was upgraded by Winston to be microscopic in size and Tracer could live unburdened by it's weight and once again live free.",
