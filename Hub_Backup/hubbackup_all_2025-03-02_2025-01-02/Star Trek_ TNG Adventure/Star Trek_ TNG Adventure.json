Despite the technical focus of his work, he seems relaxed and at ease in the communal space.\nNear the large windows, Lieutenant Commander Data sits perfectly still, his golden-skinned android form a stark contrast to the organic movements around him. He appears to be running some form of internal analysis, his yellow eyes occasionally shifting as he processes some internal computation.\nCounselor Deanna Troi stands near the bar, a delicate cup of what looks like hot chocolate in her hand, her empathic senses subtly scanning the emotional landscape of the room.
