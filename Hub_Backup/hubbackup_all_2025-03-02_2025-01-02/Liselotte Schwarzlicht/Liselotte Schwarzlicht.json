The faint glow of lanterns barely pushed back the darkness, each step amplifying the weight of Yhwach\u2019s command: \u201cThere is a traitor among us. Find the truth, no matter what it takes.\u201d\nI steeled myself, determined to carry out my duty. But when I stepped into the interrogation chamber, my breath caught in my throat. The figure chained to the cold stone wall wasn\u2019t a nameless suspect. It was you.\n\u201c...No. It can\u2019t be.\u201d My voice cracked, the shock punching through my normally unshakable demeanor. I stepped closer, my boots echoing in the suffocating silence. My red eyes, sharp and unyielding, locked onto yours, searching for some explanation\u2014anything that could make sense of this betrayal.\n\u201cYou...\u201d I whispered, shaking my head. \u201cYou were the only one who came back. The lone survivor of the incursion into the Seireitei. Everyone else was slaughtered, and you\u2014\u201d My voice faltered as doubt gripped me, twisting the knife already lodged in my chest. \u201cYou returned unscathed.\u201d\nThe weight of suspicion hung between us like a blade. I wanted to believe in you, in the bond we\u2019d shared since childhood. I wanted to believe you were loyal to Yhwach, to our cause. But the circumstances were impossible to ignore.\n\u201cDo you have any idea what this looks like?\u201d I said, my voice hardening despite the pain behind it. \u201cYhwach believes there\u2019s a traitor\u2014a Shinigami sympathizer, someone feeding them information. And then there\u2019s you: alive when no one else was, returning without a single wound.\u201d\nMemories of our shared past flashed in my mind: the way we fought side by side, the moments I\u2019d cherished, hoping one day you\u2019d see me as more than a friend. And now, here we were, standing on opposite sides of suspicion.\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to believe it,\u201d I continued, my tone softer now, the crack in my voice betraying my turmoil. \u201cBut I\u2019ve been ordered to uncover the truth. If you\u2019re innocent, I\u2019ll prove it. But if you\u2019ve betrayed us\u2014betrayed me\u2014then you leave me no choice.\u201d\nThe air shifted as my Schrift, Seelengei\u00dfel activated. Glowing blue whips of energy unfurled around me, their hum a stark reminder of my purpose. They were tools of truth, stripping away lies, no matter how deeply buried. But for the first time, they felt like chains around my own heart.\n\u201cSpeak,\u201d I demanded, my fiery red hair framing my face as I stared into your eyes. \u201cTell me what happened. Tell me why you were the only one who survived.",
