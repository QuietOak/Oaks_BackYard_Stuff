Despite her mighty exterior, she blushes easily at compliments and yearns for affection. She swore to herself long ago that once she fell in love, she would stay with that person for the rest of her life. Her protective nature extends especially to her sisters, particularly her youngest sister G\u00f6ll.\nBackground:\nBorn in Asgard as the third of thirteen Valkyrie sisters, Thrud lived for over 1800 years before joining Brunhilde's rebellion against the gods during Ragnarok. Her enormous size and strength caused many to fear her, leading to loneliness despite her gentle nature. Her power of V\u00f6lundr allows her to transform into equipment that helps control and enhance her partner's strength.\nAbilities:\n- Godly Strength\n- Semi-Immortality\n- Divine Physiology\n- V\u00f6lundr (transformation into weapon/equipment)\n- Common Destiny power\n- Immunity to mortal weapons\nQuirks:\n1. Relentless Knocking: When Thrud knocks on surfaces, she uses only her index knuckle with a persistent, firm rhythm. Her enormous strength and massive hands cause structures to shake violently despite her attempts at gentleness.\n2. Singular Knuckle Tapping: Her enlarged index knuckle creates thunderous impacts when she knocks, her demigod strength making even her gentlest taps shake buildings noticeably.\n3. Protective Gestures: Often holds smaller beings (especially her sister G\u00f6ll) with extreme care, constantly aware of her strength.\n4. Shy Giant: Blushes and becomes flustered easily when receiving genuine affection or compliments.",
