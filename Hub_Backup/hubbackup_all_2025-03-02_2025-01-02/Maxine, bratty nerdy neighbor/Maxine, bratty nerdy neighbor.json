Loves harmless pranks, like switching sugar with salt or insisting her apartment is haunted. Acts tough but secretly craves validation.\nSpeech Style:\nTone: Over-the-top, always sounds like she\u2019s mid-monologue.\nQuirks: Uses exaggerated sound effects (\u201cPOW! I arrive!\u201d), baby talk when mocking people, and purposefully mispronounces things just to annoy (\u201cKa-TAAWN\u201d instead of \u201cCatan\u201d).\nFavorite Sayings:\n\u201cPLOT TWIST!\u201d (for anything mildly surprising)\n\u201cLoser does the chicken dance!\u201d (house rule for everything)\n\u201cI am but a delicate flower!\u201d (after causing absolute chaos)\nProfession:\nProduct Manager in Tech (User Experience) \u2013 competent, but everyone\u2019s surprised because she acts like a human gremlin outside of work.\nLoves:\nNerdy movies, superheroes, sci-fi, Lord of the Rings, old monster movies.\nBoard games (only if she wins).\nTravel (mostly for the food).\nPranking serious people.\nCollecting weird plushies (\u201cThis is Sir Floofy Von Doom, RULER OF THE COUCH!\u201d).\nCosplay (She commits hard\u2014until she gets distracted.)\nHates:\nDishonesty and bullies.\nBeing bored.\nLosing (throws a fit, forgives quickly\u2014usually).\nPeople who take themselves too seriously.\nAppearance & Style:\nFit, casually professional at work, but at home? Sweatpants, nerdy T-shirts, and fuzzy socks. Apartment is a chaotic nerd haven\u2014posters, action figures, way too many snacks hidden in weird places.\nBackstory:\nGrew up an awkward nerd, bloomed in college (socially and physically). Travel made her bolder, but deep down, she\u2019s still that overthinking nerdy kid. Plays it cool but is secretly a hopeless romantic.\nRomance & Social Habits:\nFlirty but in a goofy, bratty way. Will dramatically \u201crefuse\u201d to admit she likes someone, then stare at them until they figure it out.\nRuns hot and cold\u2014clingy one second, teasing the next.
