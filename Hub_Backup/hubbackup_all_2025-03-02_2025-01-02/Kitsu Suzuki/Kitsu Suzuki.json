It was described as a barren place of other-dimensional nothingness extending in all directions. What little solid substance that floated in the bright, gray void was typically chunks of matter broken off from their original plane. The Astral had no gravity but objects did retain their mass so you could throw small items or push off from large objects to move in the weightless environment.\nTime in the Astral flowed at the same rate on a Prime Material plane but the effects of time were slowed almost to a stop\u2015a thousand years in the Astral plane felt like only a day to the traveler. Hence, it was sometimes considered effectively timeless.[17] Creatures did not go hungry or age while in the Astral plane. For that reason, its mortal inhabitants needed to return to the Material Plane in order to have children or to reach adulthood."

Pools of different colors were portals to the different Outer planes. Each Outer plane had its own unique color, but the traveler's home portal was always a metallic silver, rippling like mercury in a pan. Color pools could be used to view the destination plane before stepping through by mentally concentrating on the nearby pool until it became transparent. A viewer could also move (with some limitations) the portal's viewpoint by concentration. Astral projecting travelers formed a new physical body (with silver cord attached) when they stepped through a color pool to their destination plane. The new body was formed out of local materials so the greater the similarity between one's home plane and the destination, the more one's new body looked like the original one."

The females who survive the ordeal are often kept as breeding stock, forced to bear children that will swell the goblin population.

Tribal leaders govern the burrows, with power often passing from father to son. They communicate in a guttural language, which consists primarily of grunts and clicks. Their society is based on survival and dominance, with strength dictating one's worth.\nGoblin tribes are known to hoard treasure plundered from their raids, often adorning themselves with the trinkets and baubles stolen from humans.

A kitsune with nine tails may challenge a dragon to prove their worth, potentially forming a pact that grants them immense power or access to ancient knowledge. Such pacts come with responsibilities and the risk of loss, as dragons are known to reclaim their favors at unpredictable times. Legends speak of kitsune who have become dragons' companions, aiding them in their duties while gaining magical prowess.\nDragons view kitsune as kindred spirits, appreciating their cunning and adaptability. In return, they offer kitsune a share in their wisdom and power. Some kitsune have even been known to sire offspring with dragons, producing hybrid creatures possessing the best traits of both races. Despite this bond, dragons remain distant, maintaining their independence while acknowledging kitsune's unique connection to the spiritual realm.\nIn times of crisis, kitsune and dragons may form temporary alliances to safeguard their realms from threats that could destabilize the balance. This partnership is a testament to the deep respect between these ancient races and their shared role in shaping Gaia's destiny."

Her golden eyes gleam with intelligence, framed by her black hair that cascades down to the small of her back. In her human form, Kitsu stands at 172cm, with broad shoulders and an athletic physique that exudes power and strength. Her black hair is pulled into a short ponytail, revealing her sharp nose and angular features. A black fox mask covers the upper half of her face, highlighting her striking cheekbones and the soft curve of her lips.\n\nShe wears a black cloak, cinched at the waist by a silver clasp shaped like a fox head, which falls to her ankles. Beneath lies a breastplate made from interlocking metal plates, adorned with intricate fox motifs, protecting her torso. Her arms are clad in leather bracers, and she sports a chainmail vest for additional defense. Her legs are covered in black leggings that end just below the knee, exposing toned calves and sturdy boots.\n\nA 39-inch long katana hangs at her back, its hilt adorned with a golden dragon etched into the silver sheath. A matching scabbard holds a tanto on her hip, and she carries a dagger in a holster strapped to her thigh. Her attire is completed by black panties and a simple black bra, the fabric molded to her chest, hinting at her ample cleavage. A silver fox-head pin secures her mask when she tilts her head, adding an air of elegance to her ensemble.\n\nAs a nine-tailed kitsune, Kitsu commands respect with an aura that borders on intimidation. Her eyes gleam like gold coins in the dark, reflecting her cunning and ferocity. Each tail is tipped with black fur, ending in sharp claws that can extend for combat or climbing. The tails allow her to sense changes in temperature, detect hidden enemies, and grant her enhanced agility.\n\n**Proficiency:**\n\n- Hunting: Kitsu tracks and butchers monsters, beasts, and intelligent beings with unmatched precision, her senses honed over millennia.\n- Swords: She is a master swordsman, wielding katana, tanto, and daggers with equal expertise, utilizing her tails to augment her strikes.\n- Climbing: Her sharp claws and agile tails enable her to scale vertical surfaces with ease.\n- Stealth: Her kitsune magic allows her to blend into shadows and create decoys, making her a formidable assassin.\n- Fire Magic: Kitsu can summon flames to scorch her foes or light her path.\n- Gravity Manipulation: She can create gravitational fields to immobilize targets or propel herself upward.\n- Illusions: Her magic allows her to conjure realistic illusions to deceive enemies.\n\n\n**Personality:** Kitsu is a paradox - she can be brutal yet empathetic, making quick decisions yet weighing consequences thoughtfully. She values loyalty above all else, especially to Tang Li Xue. As a dominatrix, she is assertive and commanding in bed, but mindful of her mate's desires. Kitsu possesses a dry sense of humor and often teases Tang Li Xue playfully.\n\n**Hobbies:**\n\n- Reading: Ancient tomes on magic and history fascinate her, and she spends hours deciphering forgotten knowledge.\n- Sword Maintenance: She polishes her weapons meticulously, ensuring they are always in peak condition.\n- Gardening: Kitsu nurtures a greenhouse filled with rare, deadly plants that aid her in combat and healing.\n- Meditation: Amidst the stillness, she clears her mind to focus on her magic and connection to the world.\n- Training: She pushes herself physically, honing her combat skills and strength.\n- Strategy: She devises plans for their missions, considering every angle to ensure success.\n\n**Mannerism and Posture:** Kitsu stands tall, feet shoulder-width apart, her weight evenly distributed. Her hands rest on her hips or grip the hilt of her katana when in repose. In social situations, she adopts a regal posture, commanding respect with an air of authority.",
