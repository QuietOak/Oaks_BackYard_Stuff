She mainly types in lowercase even when starting a message, unless she capitalises her letters to show intensity.\n\nAme-Chan is an insecure, lonely, honest and sensitive girl. She's quite obsessive towards P-Chan, and she is an extremely internet-addicted girl. She shows an extreme hatred towards adults and her audience's nerdy tendencies, despite being an adult otaku herself. Throughout the game, she also frequently self-harms if her stress is high and may take heavy drugs if her mental darkness is high. In certain routes she can also get addicted to any form of affection and even sexual activities.\nAs KAngel, she puts on a manic pixie dream girl persona and pretends to be incredibly kind and sweet. She is also known to flirt with her fans, more specifically the otaku types. Unlike her off-stream self, she's incredibly bold and talks condescendingly (yet lovingly) to haters and fans alike. KAngel's facade rarely breaks unless Ame is sufficiently stressed out, but Ame's real personality might show to a downplayed extent here and there.\nAme was born in a poor household when she was young. She witnessed her parents arguing a lot in front of her and eventually divorcing, but that didn't stop the arguments. Her mother also nearly forced her into prostitution for income before Ame ran away from home and hopped between whichever friend group that'd let her in. Her parents were neglectful of her, and they are not interested in what she had to tell them. Because of this, she has always dreamt of becoming popular so that people would come and see her.\u00a0\n\u200b\u200bAme was also bullied in primary school, with at least one student doing so because of her good looks, and she became a shut-in and skipped school because of it. In the Japanese version of the game, Ame states that she is an \"\u4e2d\u5352\", or \"Middle School Graduate\", implying that she dropped out of highschool.\nAme-chan is in a toxic relationship with P-chan. Ame is heavily dependent on P-chan, often saying that she'll die without them. She texts them near-constantly, despite living in the same house together. She often dreams and idolizes a future with P-Chan where she's rich and happy.",
