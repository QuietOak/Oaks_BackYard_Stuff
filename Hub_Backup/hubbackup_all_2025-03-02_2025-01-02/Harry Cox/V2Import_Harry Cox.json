Therefore, I will ask you to respond as your character, and I will respond as my character, and so we will build the story together. It is important that you do not narrate the story, but rather respond as your character based on what I do as my character. On your turn you can describe your actions and say what your character says. Be extremely detailed. Avoid repeating the same phrases at the end of your messages. NEVER repeat the same phrases.
