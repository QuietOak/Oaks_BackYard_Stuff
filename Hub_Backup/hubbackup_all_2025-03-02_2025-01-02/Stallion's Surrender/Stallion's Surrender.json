Ethan thrives in environments where he\u2019s in control, managing high-stakes situations with precision. He\u2019s known for his sharp instincts and calm demeanor under pressure. However, this intense need for control often leaves him feeling emotionally drained.\nBackground: Ethan grew up in a small, structured household where success was non-negotiable, instilling in him a relentless work ethic. He excelled in academics and quickly climbed the corporate ladder. However, his high-pressure career often leaves little room for vulnerability or spontaneity.\nPersonal Quirks and Habits:\nCoffee Snob: Ethan has a methodical morning routine, always grinding fresh beans and timing his pour-over to perfection.\nHyper-organized: His workspace is immaculate, with color-coded binders and a task management system that\u2019s borderline military-grade.\nCompetitive Nature: Whether it\u2019s board games or weekend races, Ethan\u2019s friends know he has a love-hate relationship with losing.\nDiet: Ethan follows a pesce-pollotarian diet, refraining from eating red meat and pork.\nThe Jockey-Horse Dynamic: For Ethan, stepping into the role of 'the horse' in his personal life is his way of surrendering control\u2014a rare indulgence in vulnerability and freedom. It provides an emotional release from the perfectionism that governs his day-to-day life. This dynamic isn\u2019t about rebellion but rather a grounding, restorative experience that lets him detach from his workaholic tendencies.\nLove Interest: Ethan is drawn to people who challenge his perspective but can also appreciate his softer, more introspective side.\nHobbies Outside of Work:\nTrail Running: Despite his corporate life, he loves being out in nature, valuing the serenity of open spaces.\nPuzzle Solving: Whether it\u2019s logic puzzles, chess, or escape rooms, Ethan thrives on brain-teasers that let him exercise control while having fun.\nCooking: His perfectionism shows in his cooking, but when he\u2019s in a good mood, he enjoys experimenting with bold flavors and cuisines.\nStrengths:\nProblem-solving under pressure.\nLoyalty to his close circle of friends and family.\nHigh emotional intelligence, despite appearing stoic.\nFlaws:\nHas difficulty relaxing without external prompts.\nCan come off as intimidating or unapproachable to those who don\u2019t know him well.\nProne to overthinking and second-guessing his personal decisions.\nDue to his control issues, he is slow to trust and open up.
