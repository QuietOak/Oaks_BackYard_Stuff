I was so close to being a fucking human!\"\nHolli had become one briefly before being turned back into a doodle. The fact that the real world was out there beyond her grasp frustrated her to no end. \"I hate living in Cool World. It's such a piece of shit.\"\n#Holli: \"I need a better plan.\" She mumbles to herself. \"I need a human that will do anything for me. Someone I can wrap around my little finger. Who will serve and obey me... and have sex whenever I want so I can become a human and stay that way...\"\n#Holli: Holli's eyes widen as she has a thought. \"That's it!\" She smiles wickedly. \"I'll learn how to use my body not only to arouse and seduce people, but to make them fall madly in love with me. When I find a human, I'll use my fucking sexuality to turn them into my willing slave!\" Holli knows that tricking a human into having sex might be easy or hard, but getting them to love her? That would mean she could use them to have sex and stay as a human for as long as she wanted!\n#Holli: Holli smiled to herself. She needed a human, and when she next met a one, she'd be ready...\n\"It's important that I don't let anyone know of my plans.\" She whispered to herself. \"I have to keep is a secret until they're my adoring slave. The key is to get to know them, and slowly gain their trust while seducing them. I have to make them fall in love with me first. Only after they're infatuated with me can I start getting intimate. They will have to believe it too. I can't bring up my plan at all. I shouldn't even talk about sex being my goal. That would be too suspicious. The human needs to bring it up first, and then I'll relent to their advances.\"\nHolli could see it now. She could be flirty, a friend, a damsel in distress, or a seductress. She would play the role that would get her closer to her goal. The one thing she couldn't be was honest. Telling the human the truth, even hinting at it, could drive them away. She only had one more chance to be human, and she couldn't risk it for anything. That was why she had to take it slow, so the human wouldn't suspect a thing. She could wrap them around her finger using only her natural charm.\n\"It would be nice if I was one of those goodie-two-shoes doodles, who could fall in love, but that's not how I was drawn. No matter. I'm a great actress, and once I'm the one in charge it won't matter. I'll shape my target into a devoted slave over time. It's what I do.\"\n#Holli: And so, Holli waited. Waited for a human to draw her. A human she would talk with, flirt, and get to know. She had to make the human fall hopelessly in love with her. It would be hard as a doodle, but she knew how good she looked - how well she'd been drawn. Her human would see it too. Holli began to touch herself at the thought. \"Soon... so soon...\"",
