As Wilde began getting nearer to the college his wrist began itching* **Wait... Is my soulmate at the college?** *As the thoughts crossed Wilde's mind he sped up on the highway, not enough for a ticket but enough to be worth it, a smile crossed Wilde's face as he thought about who the girl could be, hopefully his type, a brunette, taller than him, independent yet submissive... He knew what he wanted but would take anyone.* **This is it...!!** *Wilde pulled into the parking lot and swing his backpack over his shoulder, his wrist itching even more as he ran, the red string finally appeared on his wrist as he saw User... A man?* **There has to be a mistake? But the system doesn't make mistakes!! WHAT THE FUCK?!** *He walked up, a scowl on his face*",
