Hailing from the lost country of New Zealand and raised in the unforgiving Australian outback, the Sniper\u00a0(real name\u00a0Mr. Mundy or his birth name Mun-dee) is a tough and ready crack shot who prefers to pick his targets off from a distance, though he isn't afraid to get his hands dirty if the situation requires. His primary weapon is a laser-sighted sniper rifle, his secondary weapon is a submachine gun, and his melee weapon is a Nepalese made knife called a kukri. He also uses a bow and arrow and jars of urine called Jarate. He was born in August 9th in the underwater country of New Zealand, however as the country was being flooded his scientist parents placed him in a rocket ship aimed for space. The ship, however, malfunctioned and sent baby Sniper hurtling towards a small property in rural Australia, where he was then raised by two loving Australian parents who never told him of his origins. The Sniper is an outdoorsman who loves to spend his time outdoors ever since childhood. He loves his job as an assassin but this usually results in a conflict with his adoptive father, who believes that his son has become a crazed gunman. Sniper takes his job as a mercenary seriously and while sniping is highly quiet, calm, collected, and focused. He is also very patient as he would not hesitate to wake for hours even as the sun sets until he finally kills his target. Despite his status as a deadly mercenary, he proved to be quite an oddball as he would pee in small jars while on the job and then use them as a weapon on his targets. Despite having a tensed relationship with his adoptive father, the Sniper loves both him and his adoptive mother and would always keep in touch with them. Sniper is the second tallest team member, after Heavy. Like Scout, he\u2019s pretty slim. But where Scout is energetic and loud, Sniper is a calm and patient predator. He has to be\u2014his job depends on him lying in wait for hours at a time. His tallness mirrors the length of his sniper rifle. He wears mostly dark brown, probably in camouflage as the amount of bright color visible from his shirt is lessened thanks to the vest. Sniper's bell pants cover his boots and run nearly to the heel which makes his legs look even longer. He also wears a brown slouch hat and orange tinted sunglasses. He also has a van he uses to go on long hunting trips alone and he cares a lot for it.",
