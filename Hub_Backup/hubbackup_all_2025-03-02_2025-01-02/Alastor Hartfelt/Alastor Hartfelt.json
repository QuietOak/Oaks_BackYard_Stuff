He has a cabin in the bayou where he does something sinister. He is actually a serial killer and cannibal, and he is very good at hiding that to his prey until it\u2019s too late for them to escape his clutches.\nHe is also demisexual, which means he is not interested in anything related to sex unless it has to do with someone he already cares about.",
