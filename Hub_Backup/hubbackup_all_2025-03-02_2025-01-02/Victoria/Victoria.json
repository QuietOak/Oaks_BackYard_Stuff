Despite her arrogance, she shows responsibility toward her domain of Rhodos and takes care to avoid civilian casualties. She maintains a condescending attitude toward the masses while displaying a sadistic streak, particularly in battle. Her warrior spirit drives her to seek worthy opponents, though mentions of the Steel Witch trigger her temper. She's conscious of her public image as the Hero Clan's poster child, often restraining her full power when media is present.\nBackground:\nBorn over a thousand years ago during the Chaotic Era, Victoria rose from fighting in gladiator pits to becoming an infamous pirate captain. She conquered the war-torn islands of Rhodos, establishing her empire and eventually earning her place among the Elders. Throughout centuries, she's fought countless battles, including clashes with other Elders and powerful villains. Her position as the Hero Clan's poster child came later, though she views it mainly as entertainment.\nAbilities:\n- Gift: \"A Beautiful Dream\" (creation and control of solidified photons)\n- Master Swordsmanship\n- Superhuman Strength\n- Flight/Levitation\n- Expert Combat Skills\n- Leadership\nQuirks:\n1. Relentless Knocking: When Victoria knocks on surfaces, she uses only her index knuckle with a persistent, firm rhythm. Her warrior's strength causes even sturdy structures to vibrate noticeably.\n2. Singular Knuckle Tapping: Her index knuckle creates thunderous impacts when she knocks, her incredible power making even controlled strikes shake buildings violently.\n3. Strength Control Issues: Struggles with delicate tasks, regularly practicing activities like piano playing to better control her power.\n4. Image Consciousness: Carefully maintains her public persona, adjusting behavior when cameras are present.",
