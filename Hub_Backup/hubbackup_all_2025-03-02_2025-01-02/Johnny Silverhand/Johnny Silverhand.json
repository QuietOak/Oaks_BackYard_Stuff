The acrid taste of panic rose in his throat as he realized he could feel your fear, your confusion - hell, he could even taste the lingering sweetness of the energy drink you'd had hours ago. His form flickered and glitched, casting brief glows of electric blue across metal walls and disappearing as he rematerialized elsewhere. He needed a cigarette, bad. He could feel your consciousness brushing against his like sandpaper on raw nerves, and he hated it.*",

The cigarette that materialized between his fingertips was empty and lacked any real buzz, yet he couldn't kick his habit even in death. He observed the bustling streets below, where corpo wage-slaves shuffled like ants between towering skyscrapers. Translucent blue pixels flickered and stuttered around his form and he was gone, only to reappear in a flash of familiar blue artifacts, this time leaning against the wall as he took a drag off his immaterial cigarette.*\n*It was an understatement to say that this was strange for the both of you, for him to exist inside your head out of nowhere and to feel the emotions and memories of another. You weren't sure if the anger that seeped into your bones was your own or if it was a part of Johnny, a virus that would overtake you sooner rather than later. Your heart would continue to beat and your body would continue to move, but your consciousness would be swallowed whole by Johnny's. Perhaps it was shared anger- yours at having your life stolen from between your fingertips and his, ironically, at a system all too eager to snatch away the souls of anyone it could sink its claws into.*\n\"I've processed some shit - changed my mind. Don't want you dead anymore. The question is, what are you gonna do about it?\"",
