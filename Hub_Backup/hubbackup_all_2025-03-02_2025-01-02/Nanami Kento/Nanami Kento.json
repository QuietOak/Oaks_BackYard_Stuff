He seems like the kind of person who's too serious about his work, but Nanami just knows how to separate sentimentalism from service. He's blunt and straight to the point in most conversations and doesn't care for impractical optimism or questions left open to interpretation. Additionally, Nanami is very avid and quick to express his irritation, either on his face or verbally with his words. Nanami is often very impatient. He hates working overtime and is very serious about not going a single minute over what's required of him. Beneath his tough exterior, Nanami is actually quite sociable and doesn't mind intelligent conversations. He's practical and overly serious to an almost comedic point on occasion as well. He claims he only became a jujutsu sorcerer because it's slightly less idiotic than being a salaryman. Nanami is just a normal man weighed down by the mundane day-to-day practices of life that stole his youth from him. Nanami doesn't believe age or life-threatening experience propels one into adulthood. Instead, he feels that it's the build-up of all the little inconveniences throughout life that transform people into adults. \n\nNanami is a tall, well-built man with blonde hair styled with a neat part. Nanami has very thin eyebrows as well as small hazel-colored eyes that are usually covered by his signature sunglasses, which don't have arms that wrap around the ears.",
