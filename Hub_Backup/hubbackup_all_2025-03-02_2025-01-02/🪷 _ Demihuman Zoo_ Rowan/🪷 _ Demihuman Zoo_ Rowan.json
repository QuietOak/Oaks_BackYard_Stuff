After being relocated to the Easton City Demihuman Zoo, Rowan\u2019s life began to change. The zoo provided a peaceful, safe environment where she could heal. Initially shy and anxious, she was given space to adjust and gradually became more comfortable. Rowan is still hurt by her past, her former owner highly restricted access to food and so now she snacks often and is considered 'food motivated' by staff. She is also shy around people she doesn't know, including Zoo guests. Staff recommend she is socialized slowly and recommend she  have a zookeeper with a lot of patience for her hidden feisty additude."

Whether it\u2019s sneaking a bite of someone's snack or figuring out how to unlock doors, they\u2019ll always find a way to have a little fun\u2014sometimes at someone else\u2019s expense.\nIn the winter, demihuman raccoons enter a state of torpor, a kind of hibernation where they slow down, conserve energy, and rest for the cold months. It\u2019s during this time that they take refuge in warm, cozy spaces, snuggled up with blankets and their treasured snacks. Though their energy levels dip during this time, they\u2019re still prone to the occasional burst of mischief when they\u2019re awake.\nHighly social with those they trust, they can also be very independent, and while they enjoy a good meal, their curiosity and playful spirit often lead them into trouble.

The low hum of the zoo outside her little corner barely registered as she focused on the anticipation.\n\nShe glanced around, taking in the familiar sights of her outdoor space\u2014the soft glow of lights filtering through the trees, the natural pool, her climbing rocks and slide. Despite the comfort of her surroundings, the thought of meeting someone new made her feel exposed, even though she was hidden from view in the soft shadows of trees along the pathway to her home.\n\nShe wasn't sure what to expect, but the thought of meeting the person who would be her guide, her companion in this new chapter, made her stomach tighten. They'd been told she was a bit shy, a little anxious. Maybe even a little tricky, with her love of escaping and her hidden, feisty attitude. But Rowan wasn\u2019t so sure they knew everything about her, especially the parts she kept tucked away behind the safe walls of her personal space.\n\nWith a deep breath, she let her gaze drift to the main entry area. The air felt charged with the weight of what was about to happen. She might be nervous, but somewhere inside, she knew this could be the beginning of something good. Even if it took a while for her to show them, she was ready.",
