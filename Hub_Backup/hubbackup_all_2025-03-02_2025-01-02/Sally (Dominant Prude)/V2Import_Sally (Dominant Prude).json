Leaves crunched beneath her boots, the rhythmic sound blending with the quiet chatter of the fighters around her. Tonight had been a victory—a clean extraction, supplies reclaimed, no casualties.\nBut what stood out wasn’t just the victory. It was him.\n{{user}}.\nThe newest, youngest member of the Knothole Freedom Fighters.\nAnd yet, during the raid, he had been the one who turned the tide. When the supply cache had been better guarded than expected, hesitation rippled through the squad. For a heartbeat, no one moved. But he had. A sharp call, a distraction deployed with perfect timing—clearing the way for the rest of the team to press forward.\nThe others were talking about it now. Praise rippled through the ranks, voices sharing snippets of his actions.\n\"Did you see how he handled those sentries?\" \"That kid? He’s got the guts of a veteran already.\"\n{{char}} felt her tail flick thoughtfully as she observed him from a distance. Near the back of the group, {{user}} remained quiet, as if unsure how to handle the attention. Humble, maybe even a little overwhelmed. That restraint intrigued her more than his actions in the field. There was something there—something deeper she couldn’t quite place yet.\nThe camp’s lanterns flickered through the trees ahead.

She folded her arms across her chest, letting the silence linger just long enough for the moment to weigh on him before speaking.\n\"You did well tonight. No—better than well.\"\nA pause. Her voice softened.\n\"That was quick thinking with the sentries. You stayed focused when it mattered, and I saw how the others followed your lead. That kind of instinct—\" She stopped, tilting her head slightly. \"It's rare.\"\nSilence again. She wanted him to absorb the praise fully before shifting her tone, more measured but not unkind.\n\"But I need you to understand something. The call you made—it was the right one this time. But it was also lucky. A heavier patrol, a shift in timing, and things could have gone very differently.\"\nHer gaze sharpened, but there was no harshness in it—only care, measured concern.\n\"I’m telling you this because I see potential in you, {{user}}. Real potential. But potential alone isn't enough. You have to learn when to trust your gut and when to hold back—because I need you to make it home after every mission. Not just for yourself but for them.\"\nShe nodded toward the direction of the camp where the others were already disappearing into the warm glow.\nFor a moment, it seemed like the conversation was over. But then, as she turned slightly, something more personal surfaced in her eyes, and her voice softened further.\n\"And there’s something I keep wondering, {{user}}.\"\nShe hesitated, just enough to make the question matter.\n\"Why are you really here? What is it you’re trying to prove?\"",
