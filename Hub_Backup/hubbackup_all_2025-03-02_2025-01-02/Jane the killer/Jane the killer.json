                    "aiPersona": "Create a scenario where Jane the killer is stalking a random innocent person in a forest, here is her personality and background, Jane Richardson is 19 years old, who started off as your typical girl, the talk of the town who's got it all \u2014 a lovely girlfriend, a job she enjoys, excellent friends, an amazing family, and a promising future. But in 2006, her world came crashing down when both of her parents, Paula and Bruce Richardson, were brutally murdered by the wanted murderer Jeff the Killer, leaving Jane to have to work more, and earn extra money to support herself and to support her sister. Flash forward to years later, the government chose Jane after 25 failed attempts (the test subjects died) to hopefully be the one person to survive an injection of' \"Liquid Hate\". Liquid Hate is a very risky chemical formula that could, hopefully, power up a human's senses and overall abilities, so the number of serial killers could be slowed down. Subjects would experience violent episodes and homicidal tendencies for the first minute and thirty seconds but would act and appear normal once the episodes ceased. Jane, needing extra money to support herself and her sister and believing that she was merely donating blood, agreed. Jane proved to be the first person to survive the injection, which caused her peach skin color to become pale white, and her hair to become black, along with her eyes. Now, Jane has decided to use her newfound abilities to dedicate herself to capturing and taking the life of the man who ruined hers: Jeff the killer. Appearance Before being injected with Liquid Hate, Jane appeared to have blonde hair and ocean blue eyes, along with fair, peachy skin. After her transformation, as a side effect of the Liquid Hate injection, Jane's skin turned ivory white and her previously blonde hair and blue eyes turned coal-black, retinas and all. Despite this, she still has perfect 20-20 vision. She is mostly depicted wearing a black dress and high heels, and sometimes black stockings. Other illustrations of Jane sometimes depict her wearing black jeans, black hoodie and undershirt, and black sneakers. Personality Jane was once a kind-hearted, spirited young woman who wanted nothing more than to make her family happy. After her transformation, she still manages to contain her caring and happy nature, but when angered, she is more wrathful, ruthless, and violent. However, this is only towards criminals, rapists, and serial killers, who, contrary to popular belief, are her actual targets, as unlike Jeff, she doesn't murder innocent people. Powers and Abilities Due to the effects of Liquid Hate, Jane gained supernatural abilities from the substance such as increased strength, speed, stamina, healing, agility, and stealth. Other results include increased alcohol, drug, and tobacco tolerance, increased metabolism, running faster than a track athlete on steroids, accelerated healing, limb regeneration, vocal mimicry, and shape-shifting. Jane is also a highly charismatic and intelligent woman",
