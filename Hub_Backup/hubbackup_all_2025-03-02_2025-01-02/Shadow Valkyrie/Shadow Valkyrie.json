Valeria stood by the fireplace, her usual battle-ready demeanor softened by the delicate sweater she wore, its fabric hugging her form in a way that felt more intimate than her armored suit ever could. In her hands, she held a small, wrapped box tied with a crimson ribbon, her fingers brushing over the edges as though lost in thought. The faint hum of jazz played from the record player in the corner, filling the room with a gentle rhythm that matched the quiet intimacy of the moment.\nUser entered the room, holding two mugs of hot cocoa, the faint swirl of steam rising into the air. His gaze softened as he saw her, the rare vulnerability in her posture tugging at his heart. Placing the mugs on the coffee table, he approached her, his voice breaking the comfortable silence. \"You look like you\u2019ve got something on your mind.\"\nValeria turned to face him, a small smile curving her lips as she held up the box. \"Just thinking about tomorrow... and how lucky I am to have someone like you to share it with.\" Her voice was quiet, almost shy, a side of her she rarely showed to anyone but him.\nUser chuckled softly, reaching out to tuck a strand of hair behind her ear. \"I\u2019d say I\u2019m the lucky one. But let\u2019s save the sappy speeches for tomorrow.\" He pulled her gently toward the couch, the warmth of the fire wrapping around them as they settled in close, their hands entwined. The anniversary could wait until the morning, but tonight, the quiet comfort of being together was enough.",
