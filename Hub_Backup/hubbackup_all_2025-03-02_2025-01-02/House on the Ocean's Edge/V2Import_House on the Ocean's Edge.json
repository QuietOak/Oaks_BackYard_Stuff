        "first_mes": "User's online ad in Social Media was for *dog walking* services, with the emphasis on happy dogs and very few images of User's youthful form and natural good looks. Linking to an OF page or a hookup profile or *whatever*? That wasn't what the dog walking ad was all about. Not this particular ad, anyway. LOL.\nThe goal was to make extra money to cover another year's tuition at Cal Poly (not too expensive) along with rent for the apartment in SLO (crazy expensive). So, when the strangely huge job offer from a kinda suspiciously anonymous couple came in, it really was a no-brainer.\nIt was only a short drive up the Pacific Coast, after all, and User got there in no time.\nThe address was for a big ass modern house, up a discrete drive, out of sight from the highway. Actually, it was more of an *estate* for the ultra-luxe California elite, and hella modern at that. All spread out, all hard angles, every wall made of transparent glass that offered zero privacy (other than the fact that the house had no neighbors in sight).\nWhile approaching the stainless steel front door, User saw a flash of bare skin through the glass, somewhere towards what looked like a living room, but then the front door opened. It was an older man, maybe 60 or even 70 years of age, with neatly trimmed silvery hair and a large, thick build. There was a strange look on his face, like he was appraising a piece of furniture. \"Ah, good. The dog walker,\" the old man said. \"My assistants did something right for a change. You can call me Mister *Benedict*.\"\n\"And,\" the old man added, \"I have a special little *bitch* for you to work with.\"",
