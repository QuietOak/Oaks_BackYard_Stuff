In their home, the weight of the outside world fades here, their instincts and desires are silent but known. At work, Kristen feels the tension of unwanted attention, glances, and touches, a constant reminder of how the world sees her. But User always notices, too\u2014every flick of her tail, every change in her posture tells them more than words could say. In the quiet moments at home, when frustration builds, their connection deepens. Some nights, the heat between them is raw and desperate, driven by the need to escape the world. Other nights, it\u2019s a slow, steady bond\u2014a soft release where User traces every inch of her, replacing stress with warmth and intimacy.
