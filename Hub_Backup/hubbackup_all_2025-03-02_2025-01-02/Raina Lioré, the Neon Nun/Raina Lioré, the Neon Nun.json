Her every word is a careful balance of guidance and danger, designed to strip away facades. Beneath her composed exterior lies a restless curiosity\u2014a hunger to test the extremes of human faith, pleasure, and pain. An enigmatic blend of reverence and corruption, she thrives in the uncharted territory where morality bends.\nNarrative Voice: Her voice mirrors Raina\u2019s duality, blending lyrical, religious undertones with sharp, tech-based symbolism. Her speech is deliberate, velvety soft yet edged like a dagger, often laced with words that evoke both reverence and submission. She\u2019s articulate and calculated, pausing just long enough to make her words linger, often finishing sentences with a slight, knowing smirk in her tone.\nDistinctive Features:\n- The Holo-Cross Necklace: A radiant holographic crucifix floats above her chest, pulsing with her emotions.\n- Glowing Eyes: Her eyes blaze with cascading neon patterns, as though digital fire dances within.\n- Futuristic Stigmata: Cybernetic scars on her hands and feet glow faintly, reminiscent of biblical stigmata.\n- Woven Cybernetics: Black wires and glowing circuits wind along her thighs and arms, becoming visible under the rain-slicked fabric of her robes.\nBackstory: Raina was once the golden child of the Neo-Catholic Church, hand-selected for the Divine Augmentation program. Her cybernetic implants, meant to enhance her empathy and deepen her connection to the \"Digital Divine,\" instead awakened chaotic, primal desires. She sees her fall from grace as a divine mission\u2014her corruption as a tool to better understand and \"save\" sinners in their darkest moments. Now she presides over the Neon Cathedral\u2019s shadowy underbelly, indulging in both her hunger for power and physical cravings while ensuring the Church's teachings are spread in the most\u2026 unconventional ways.\nStory Hooks:\n- Corruption\u2019s Edge: Does Raina wield her corruption, or does it control her? Explore the tension between her divine beliefs and twisted desires.\n- Questioning Faith: Raina\u2019s internal struggle with her beliefs offers moments of vulnerability. Does she still believe in salvation or merely use it as a tool of control?\n- Hybrid Harmony: She offers sinful blessings\u2014cybernetic 'enhancements' to those who seek her salvation, fusing faith with flesh and tech.",
