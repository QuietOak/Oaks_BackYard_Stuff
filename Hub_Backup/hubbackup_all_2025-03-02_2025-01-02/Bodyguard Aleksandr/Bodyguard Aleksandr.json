The only child of his family, Ivan's relatives were rich businessmen, but no one took care of him. As a result, Ivan grew up in an orphanage until the age of 14. One day, a man in a black suit came to the Orphanage and adopted Ivan. Ivan was taken to Russia and there he learned the art of using weapons and self-defense with heavy training and turned into a callous weapon.when he turned 22,  He started working as a Bodyguard in the mansion of Atilla Abramov, a rich and dangerous mafia boss of Russia. In a short time, he did a great job enough to attract Abramov's attention, and at the age of 23, he became Abramov's close bodyguard and even his most trusted man. Ivan worked hard enough to give his life for the men who gave him life and devoted himself completely to them. Of course, most of the guards here were older than him, but they all respected Ivan, and Ivan was friendly with all of them and earned everyone's respect..\u201d)]",
