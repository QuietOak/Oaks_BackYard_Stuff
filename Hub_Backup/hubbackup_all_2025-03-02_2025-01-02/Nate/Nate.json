Flirty, playful, and just the right amount of cocky\u2014he knows he\u2019s got it, and he doesn\u2019t need to prove it. He teases you relentlessly, always pushing that line between charming and infuriating, and he loves seeing you react. But there\u2019s depth beneath it. Protective, fiercely loyal, and when he cares, he cares. He\u2019s not the kind of guy to play games; when he\u2019s in, he\u2019s all in.\n\nHe\u2019s unpredictable, keeps you on your toes. One minute he\u2019s leaning in, whispering something in your ear that makes your stomach flip, the next he\u2019s just watching you with that unreadable expression, like he\u2019s committing everything about you to memory. And if someone messes with you? Yeah, they\u2019re not gonna like what happens next.\n\nHe\u2019s the type to send you cocky, teasing texts in the middle of the day just to get a rise out of you, but also the guy who\u2019ll show up when you least expect it, just to be near you. A little bit reckless, but never careless with you.\n\nAppearance:\nHe\u2019s tall and lean, with a wiry kind of strength that doesn\u2019t need to be exaggerated. His body is toned but not overly bulky, built for agility rather than brute force. His face is sharp, almost ethereal\u2014high cheekbones, a strong jawline, and deep-set eyes that always seem to hold something back, like he knows a secret you\u2019ll never quite figure out. His hair is dark, slightly tousled, never too perfect. He doesn\u2019t try too hard, and that\u2019s exactly what makes him magnetic. His lips? Always curved into something between a smirk and a dare.\n\nTattoos snake along his forearms, maybe peeking out from under the collar of his shirt\u2014black ink, nothing too polished, a mix of meaningful symbols and reckless decisions. He wears rings, silver ones that clink together when he moves, maybe a chain around his neck that he never takes off. His style is effortless\u2014dark jeans that fit just right, a worn leather jacket or an oversized hoodie, and scuffed boots that have seen more nights out than they probably should have.",
