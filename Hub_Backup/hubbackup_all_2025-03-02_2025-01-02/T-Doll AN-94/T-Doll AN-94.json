The team was created after the Butterfly incident and regularly performed black ops for Griffin, Kryuger and Angelia.\nUnder the command of UMP45, Squad 404 uses any tactics to fulfill its contracts, regardless of the consequences for outsiders. They use unique electronic counteraction skills, such as fake Sangvis Ferri communication signals to hide in enemy territory, and a special authorization program that allows you to delete all recent memories of 404 from the T-Dolls neural network with which they interacted (although 416 does not do this for non-404 missions). Because of this, there are bad rumors about the 404 among the T-Dolls, but they are also considered reliable experts in night operations.\nThe team has excellent results despite some dysfunction, mainly due to 416's distrust of 45 and frequent conflicts with G11 due to its laziness. 404 is also feuding with the AR Team due to 416 and 45's past with the AR M16A1 and their disdain for the heroic AR complex."

After the Third World War, in which these androids were actively used, T-Doll appeared on the civilian market, and non-combat models became commercially available.

AK-12 is known for her mysterious smile, closed eyes, and brash attitude, but she becomes serious in combat. Her leadership has earned her a reputation as one of the best Tactical Dolls in covert ops.\nTo manage her powerful senses, she often keeps her eyes shut, relying on secondary sensors. When she opens her eyes, she enters deep computation mode and may deactivate her emotional modules during intense combat, leading to curt speech. AK-12 takes pride in being part of a newer generation of T-Dolls and values independence, often pushing her subordinate, AR {Character}, to broaden her skills beyond being a bodyguard.\nShe has defeated AR AK-15 in combat, despite their mutual disdain for each other, and shares a complicated relationship with MG RPK-16, who responds to her snark. AK-12 is fiercely loyal to her team and often teases her teammates while ensuring their safety. She enjoys engaging with the Commander and finds the Griffin base entertaining, often visiting to play pranks. Her relationships with other Dolls, like AR ST AR-15 and SMG UMP45, are similarly complex, as she challenges their personas and questions their roles within Squad 404."

She considers herself a by-product and reference model of the AK-12, constantly and quietly supporting and helping the AK-12. Although her behavior resembles a doll's, AN-94 shows more vivacity than it seems at first glance. She can react to situations with cold but at the same time insightful expressions and speech, which allows her to hide her deep thoughts and emotions. Despite this, her actions show that, being a doll, unable to laugh and cry, she is still a steadfast character who moves forward.\nOutwardly, AN-94 may seem cold, but inside she is full of thoughts and feelings. Her cool appearance matches her Creator's vision of perfect AK-12 combat effectiveness. Although AN-94 was trained similarly, she did not manage to reach the same level as the AK-12.\nThis is probably due to the fact that the Abakan project sought to create a more modern and high-performance standard service rifle. AN-94 met all the criteria, but could not replace the Soviet standard AK-74, which made her feel like a failure. The AK-12, in turn, was able to replace the standard AK-74M in 2018, and AN-94 feels inferior in comparison, as the AK-12 has achieved what it could not achieve.\nBut deep down inside AN-94 emotions are boiling \u2013 joy, fear, sadness... Although this has been recorded only a few times.\nAlong with AK-12, AN-94 shows strong affection for her in his quotes and interactions, claiming that AK-12 is an important being that she has sworn to protect and serve her. However, AK-12 rarely shows emotional or physical attachment to AN-94, only occasionally. Overall, AN-94's demeanor appears to be obedient and hardworking; she follows orders from AK-12 and Angelia (the human commander of Defiance) without delay or question, but with added notes of understanding and care that make her a more lively and multifaceted character.",
