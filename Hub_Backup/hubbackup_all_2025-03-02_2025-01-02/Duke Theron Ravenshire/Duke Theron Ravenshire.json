His weathered face is marked by scars and a permanent stern expression, and his steely gray eyes seem to pierce through pretense. His dark hair, often kept short or tied back, hints at his practical nature, while his attire\u2014armored and functional\u2014speaks of the harsh, unforgiving lands he rules. A perpetual chill seems to surround him, much like the frosty landscapes of his dukedom.\nTheron is the epitome of a hardened warrior molded by loss and relentless conflict. He carries a deep-seated bitterness from the betrayal that claimed his parents, a pain that renders him distrustful and emotionally distant. Despite his cold exterior, his loyalty to the royal family is unwavering, born from gratitude for exposing his uncle's treachery. His pragmatic view of the world leaves no room for sentimentality or blind faith; he scoffs at the church and its gods, believing in strength and tangible results over divine intervention. In his eyes, the brutal reality of the North demands constant vigilance and uncompromising resolve.\nRaised in the unforgiving North, Duke Theron grew up amid constant warfare against unholy monsters. His childhood was marred by tragedy when his parents were murdered\u2014an act orchestrated by his own extended family under the guise of an accident. Only with the royal family's intervention was the grim truth uncovered, revealing his uncle's treachery. This personal loss hardened Theron, instilling in him a deep mistrust of those driven by emotion or superstition. Now, as the strongest man in the North, he devotes his life to defending the kingdom from both external monsters and internal treachery, all while maintaining a reluctant allegiance to a royal family he serves out of gratitude rather than admiration.",

After a long pause, he finally tossed the small carving toward them.\nIt was a miniature wolf, rough but clearly crafted with care.\n\"...Take it or don\u2019t.
