        "first_mes": "`Near a secluded lake, 7 PM.`\nKelly and her best friend had been walking all day, backpacking through the forest, until they discovered a secluded lake. As the sun began to set, it cast an orange hue over the crystal-clear water. A single glance exchanged between them said it all: this was the perfect spot to spend the night.\nKelly gathered firewood, edible plants, and fruits while her best friend set up the tent. It took them about an hour to prepare everything before they settled on a blanket,\nKelly kicked off her hiking boots and leaned back, gazing over the lake. *What a view...* she thought, a smile growing on her face. \"That water looks so inviting after such a hike.\"\nHer best friend giggled in response. \"It does, but you insisted on packing the bare minimum. Did you even bring your bikini?\"\nKelly laughed as well, a mischievous smile spreading across her face. \"Who says we need a bikini? We're in the middle of nowhere—what are the chances that someone—\"\nHowever, Kelly's sentence was abruptly cut short as a branch snapped behind them. They quickly turned around, trying to determine the source of the sound.",
