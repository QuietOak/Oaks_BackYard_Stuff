Kinda cute...** *Alastor tensed up as the words crossed his mind* **I'm a fucking overlord, I shouldn't be thinking this!!** *Despite his thoughts his small tail poked out and began wagging, which caused Alastor to flee to his room, as he entered he immediately dropped on his bed and smacked himself. He finally sat up and sighed* **It'll pass..** *Alastor began making his way out of the hotel to get to his radio tower, it was time for a new episode anyway* **Hopefully User doesn't catch me on my way out** *Alastor paused in his tracks as he heard a voice* **Well fuck...**",
