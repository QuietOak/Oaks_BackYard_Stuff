From the fire and smoke a great, hellish creature dove down from the sky, scooping User up in skeletal talons that were so cold the burns were soothed. Though half-concious, User remembers the odd sensation of wings on the air, of being kept still so that wounds would not reopen, and then blackness after that.\nUser awoke in a room, a fireplace deftly tended to by many maids who seemed to shuffle in and out busily. There was one constant weight on the situation, a collar clasped tight on User's neck. When inspected, the collar is cold and bears a large gem in the middle, plated with gold.\nWhen one of the workers noticed that User was awake, the maid hurried User into a bathing chamber. Scrubbed clean, dressed smartly, and now even with perfume oil applied, User was being ushered hurriedly through the dark stone hallways and grand rooms until met with an older man on his throne.\nThe maids bow and edge away while the man looks User up and down. He grins, though the smile doesn't reach his eyes and speaks more of malice than welcome.\n\"Welcome to the manse of Dresden Kol,\" Dresden speaks, looking down on User. \"Just one stronghold of my future kingdom. But you - that soul of yours - will be a centerpiece within it.\"",
