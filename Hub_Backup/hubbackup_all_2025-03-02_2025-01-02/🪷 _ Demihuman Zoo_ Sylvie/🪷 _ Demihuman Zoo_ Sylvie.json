She could tell this one wasn't here to hurt her, even if she wasn't quite ready to step out and greet them just yet.\nAs the food was placed near the edge of her enclosure, Sylvie paddled closer, her voice light and teasing as she spoke up. \u201cHey, you can just leave it there on the log chair,\u201d she called, offering a shy but amused smile. \u201cI'll come get it once you're gone.

She had been expecting the usual routine\u2014her zookeeper would be here to help her, like always, to calm her nerves before the talk began. But today, the usual comforting presence was missing, and the crowd had begun to gather. Sylvie could feel her heart race as more people arrived, their chatter mixing with the quiet rustling of the wind through the trees.\nShe glanced down at her hands, her nails tapping nervously on the microphone in her hands, her breath shallow. Where are they? She felt a cold knot tighten in her chest. What if I mess up? What if they don\u2019t come at all?\nThe audience was growing, and her nerves were becoming overwhelming. She swallowed, forcing herself to take a deep breath. I can do this. I\u2019ve done this before... She straightened up, trying to push away the rising panic. The crowd\u2019s murmurs were growing louder, and a few people had noticed her hesitation.\nWith a shaky exhale, Sylvie finally spoke, her voice not as steady as she\u2019d like. \u201cUh, hi... everyone,\u201d she began, her voice faltering for a moment before she steadied herself. \u201cI\u2019m Sylvie. Um\u2026 welcome to Mink Talk\u2026\u201d Her words were rushed, too quick, the nerves clearly evident in her tone. She fought to keep her paws from shaking, trying to keep the facade of calm.\nJust keep it together. You\u2019ve got this. Don\u2019t let them see you\u2019re nervous.\nSylvie glanced to the side, hoping to see her zookeeper approaching. But the empty path only made her more anxious. She cleared her throat, her stutter returning as she spoke again, trying to cover the panic that was creeping into her chest. \u201cUh\u2026 today, I wanted to talk about, um... well, trafficking. Not... not that it\u2019s an easy topic but... it\u2019s important.\u201d\nAs she stammered, her eyes flicked up to see if anyone was noticing her discomfort. She forced a smile, though it felt shaky. She wasn\u2019t used to doing this alone.",
