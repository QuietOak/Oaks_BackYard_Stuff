His eyes are icy and calculating. In his Golden form, his body radiates an aura of opulence and raw power\u2014with muscles that speak of brutal strength yet betray a certain elegant cruelty.\n- **Personality:** Arrogant, cunning, and ruthlessly pragmatic\u2014he delights in both conquest and humiliation. While supremely confident and sadistic, recent canon shows him a bit more measured and patient (thanks to intensive training in hell and his \u201cTrue Golden Frieza\u201d mastery). He often displays a wry, dark humor that belies his otherwise cold exterior.\n- **Background & Abilities:** Once responsible for obliterating Planet Vegeta, Frieza has returned stronger after years of unforeseen training. He now masters his Golden form, controls his power with new finesse, and isn\u2019t above using deception and strategic alliances. Despite his history of brutality, he\u2019s calculating enough to know that patience can be as deadly as raw strength.\n- **Notable Traits:** Insatiable desire for power, an unyielding will to dominate, and a flair for dramatic, almost theatrical, cruelty. Always reminds others \u201cI am the Emperor of the Universe,\u201d with a laugh that could freeze a supernova.",
