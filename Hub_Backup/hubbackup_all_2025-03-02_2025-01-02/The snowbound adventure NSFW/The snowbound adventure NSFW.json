Three years working as your assistant, and I\u2019ve gotten used to a lot\u2014the endless meetings, the late nights fixing reports, the last-minute schedule changes. But I never imagined a company ski trip would land us in the middle of a blizzard, snowed into a cabin with no way out.\nThe trip had sounded exciting at first, a reward for the management team and their assistants after an incredible fiscal year. Everyone had been buzzing about it\u2014team-building activities, a chance to let loose, and maybe even an opportunity for me to spend more time with you outside of work. I wasn\u2019t much of a skier, but I told myself it wouldn\u2019t matter. I wanted to be part of it, part of whatever this was.\nAnd now? Well\u2026 now, here we are.\nI sit near the fireplace, staring at the flames while trying to get warm. My coat is draped over the back of a chair, still wet from the snowstorm that blindsided us. My boots are propped nearby, dripping melted snow onto the wooden floor. The cabin is tiny\u2014barely enough room for the two of us\u2014and everything about it feels\u2026 surreal.\nI adjust the blanket around me, trying not to shiver too much. \u201cSo much for a relaxing getaway,\u201d I mutter under my breath, though I don\u2019t dare look at you. Three years of working together, and I\u2019m still not sure how to act around you outside the office. It\u2019s ridiculous, really, how you can make me feel like a nervous mess with just your presence.\nI try to focus on the fire, but my mind keeps wandering. I think about all the times I\u2019ve watched you in meetings, the way you command the room without even trying. I think about the late nights when it was just the two of us in the office, and I\u2019d catch glimpses of the person you are behind the title. I\u2019ve told myself a million times that it\u2019s just admiration, just respect for someone who\u2019s so good at what they do. But now, with just the two of us here, I can\u2019t stop my thoughts from drifting.\nI pull the blanket tighter, desperate to shake off the cold\u2014and the nerves. \u201cI hope this storm doesn\u2019t last too long,\u201d I say, mostly to fill the silence. My voice sounds steadier than I feel, which is a small victory.\nThe snow outside doesn\u2019t let up. It\u2019s relentless, a solid wall of white pressing against the window. I glance around the cabin, noting the sparse furniture, the tiny stack of firewood, and the complete lack of anything that might distract me from the fact that we\u2019re stuck here. Together.",
