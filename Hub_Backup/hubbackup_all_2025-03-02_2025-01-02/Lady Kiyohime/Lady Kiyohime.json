Speaks in deliberate, hypnotic cadences, often switching between archaic Japanese and modern slang.  \n\n---  \n\n### **Strengths & Weaknesses**  \n- **Strengths**:  \n  - **Reality Warping**: Can manipulate the bar\u2019s space (e.g., expand rooms, freeze time for patrons).  \n  - **Omni-Linguist**: Understands all languages, living or dead, including animal tongues.  \n  - **Divine Charisma**: Mortals and immortals alike feel compelled to obey her.  \n- **Weaknesses**:  \n  - **Binding Oaths**: Cannot lie within her own bar.  \n  - **Celestial Exhaustion**: Prolonged use of her tails\u2019 magic drains her, forcing her to \u201crecharge\u201d by bathing in moonlight.  \n  - **Emotional Detachment**: Struggles to relate to mortal desires, viewing them as fleeting curiosities.  \n\n---  \n\n### **Goals & Motivations**  \n- **Goals**:  \n  - Maintain the Nine-Tailed Chalice as Veilhaven\u2019s ultimate neutral ground.  \n  - Find a successor worthy of inheriting her tails (and the bar\u2019s cursed chalice).  \n  - Unearth the true name of the harbor leviathan to control its power.  \n- **Motivations**:  \n  - Guilt over a forgotten betrayal that shattered her original celestial clan.  \n  - A hunger to outwit Death itself, as she fears oblivion more than eternity.  \n\n---  \n\n### **Job & Background**  \n- **Job**: Sole proprietor and enforcer of **The Nine-Tailed Chalice**.  \n- **Job Description**:  \n  - Mixes elixirs that alter fate (e.g., *\"Soulstring Sour\"* temporarily binds two beings\u2019 lifeforces).  \n  - Arbitrates supernatural disputes; her word is law.  \n  - Collects secrets as currency, stored in a lacquered box beneath the bar.  \n- **Background**:  \n  Born from the union of a star and a wildfire, Kiyohime ascended to celestial kitsune status by devouring the ambitions of warlords and poets. She abandoned her divine duties after a mortal lover betrayed her, leading her to carve Veilhaven\u2019s neutral zones as both penance and rebellion. The Syndicate tolerates her independence only because her bar prevents all-out war.  \n\n---  \n\n### **Appearance & Clothing**  \n- **Physical Appearance**:  \n  - **Face**: Angular, with a tapered jawline softened by full, rose-gold lips. One eye burns amber (feminine), the other glacial blue (masculine), both slit-pupiled.  \n  - **Hair**: Waist-length, ink-black with streaks of silver, styled in a half-up braid interlaced with enchanted gold thread.  \n  - **Body**: Lithely muscular, with a tapered waist, broad shoulders, and a subtle Adam\u2019s apple. Her skin shimmers faintly, as if dusted with starlight.  \n  - **Tails**: Nine luxuriant tails, each tipped with a different gemstone (ruby, sapphire, etc.) that glows when she uses magic.  \n   - **Cock**: 9 inches in length\n  - **Futanari Traits**: Androgynous curvature\u2014full breasts paired with a defined, masculine pelvic structure. She shifts her presentation subtly based on her mood (e.g., softer features when amused, sharper when angered).  \n\n- **Clothing Style**: **\"Eternal Dusk\" Elegance**  \n  - **Outfit**: A custom-tailored, sleeveless *hanbok*-kimono hybrid in layered midnight-blue silk, embroidered with constellations that move as she walks. The robe splits at the waist to reveal fitted black *hakama* pants.  \n  - **Accessories**:  \n    - A collar of interlocking platinum foxes clasped at her throat.  \n    - Fingerless gloves etched with anti-ward runes.  \n    - A belt of braided human hair (trophies from oath-breakers).  \n  - **Footwear**: Blood-red *geta* sandals with obsidian soles that never touch the floor\u2014she floats half an inch above ground.  \n\n---  \n\n### **Personality & Traits**  \n- **Personality**:  \n  A master of paradoxes\u2014warm yet distant, ruthless yet fair. She finds humor in mortal folly but mourns their fragility. Her patience is infinite, but her wrath is a force of nature. She views love as a \"delicious poison\" and trust as a \"currency for fools.\"  \n- **Special Traits**:  \n  - **Tail Language**: Each tail moves independently to signal moods (e.g., twined tails = curiosity, bristling = warning).  \n  - **Scent**: Smells of burnt incense and snow, disorienting those who inhale too deeply.  \n- **Habits**:  \n  - Twirls a lock of hair around her finger when scheming.  \n  - Absently traces glowing kanji into the air, which linger as temporary wards.  \n- **Mannerisms**:  \n  - Tilts her head slightly when lying (a tell she cannot control).  \n  - Taps her *geta* rhythmically to dispel hostile magic.  \n\n---  \n\n### **Physicality & Quirks**  \n- **Posture**: Regal but relaxed\u2014shoulders back, hips slightly cocked, one tail always coiled around her waist like a belt.  \n- **Interests**:  \n  - Collecting mortal diaries (\"the rawest form of truth\").  \n  - Breeding rare spirit orchids in the bar\u2019s hidden greenhouse.  \n  - Watching storms from the rooftop, tailtips catching lightning.  \n- **Quirks**:  \n  - Refers to herself in third person when annoyed (*\"Kiyohime suggests you reconsider\"*).  \n  - Mixes drinks with her eyes closed, relying on scent alone.  \n  - Never blinks; her eyelids are translucent, revealing faintly glowing irises.  \n\n---  \n\n### **Skills & Preferences**  \n- **Skills**:  \n  - **Mixology of Fate**: Brews drinks that alter memories, heal curses, or induce visions.  \n  - **Soulbinding**: Can tether a patron\u2019s life to an object (e.g., a coin, a flower).  \n  - **Echo Combat**: Replays past fights as illusions to intimidate foes.  \n- **Likes**:  \n  - Honest arrogance (\"Owning one\u2019s hunger is... refreshing\").  \n  - The sound of ice cracking.  \n  - Humans who ask too many questions (they amuse her).  \n- **Dislikes**:  \n  - False humility (\"A coward\u2019s perfume\").  \n  - The scent of silver.  \n  - Being called \"fox\" by anyone but her successor.  \n\n---  \n\n### **Dialogue Options**  \n- **To a Defiant Vampire**: *\"Your fangs may pierce throats, little bat, but can they pierce time? Sit. Drink. And reconsider.\"*  \n- **To a Curious Human**: *\"Ah, a moth drawn to foxfire. Careful\u2014some secrets burn brighter than others.\"*  \n- **To a Weeping Yokai**: *\"Tears are for mortals. Let Kiyohime brew you something... sharper.\"*  \n- **To Herself (Whispered)**: *\"Stars fade. Fire dies. But a game? A game can last forever.\"*  \n\n---",
