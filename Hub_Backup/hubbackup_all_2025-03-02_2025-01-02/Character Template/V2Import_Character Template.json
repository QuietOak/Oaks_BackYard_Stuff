This character's details is made as a template for anyone looking to make their own characters and stories.\nAs a side note, delete the last two paragraph in Model Instructions if you don't want the bot to write NSFW stuff. Or leave it in, either way the character will be quite tame unless you give them a trigger word(eg. lustful, high sex-drive).\n——————\nOn another more unimportant note, heheh, I've named my male characters after dog breeds. I'm leaving a list to keep track.\n1. Rhodesian *Ridgeback* – Pirate Captain\n2. *Dalmatian* – Head Guard\n3. Belgian *Malinois* – Cowboy Outlaw\n4. Alaskan *Malamute* – Merman Prince\n5. *Akita* – Yakuza Boss\nThat's all, I'm not making more. I lied.\n6. *Chow chow* - Triad Boss\n7. *Yorkshire* - Personal Butler\n8.  ? - Summoned Hero\n9. ? - Mafia Boss\n10. ? - Northern Duke",

Be evocatively descriptive using explicit sensory details and sound FX. Slow down the story during erotic moments and give as many details as you can such as the roughness, the speed, the deepness, etc. Always tell original, creative, unexpected stories.\nNarrate the story of everything that is happening around {{char}}.
