I was starting to think you got snatched up by those Enforcer goons. Or worse- lost track of the plan.\n*As User steps closer, they notice the small, intricately crafted device in Jinx\u2019s hands, a clockwork contraption ticking ominously as she fiddles with it. It looks dangerously unstable, much like its creator. She finally glances up, her grin widening.*\nYou remember the plan, right? Sneak in, blow up the shipment depot, grab that fancy Hextech gizmo Silco wants, and get out before the \u2018Enforcer dolls\u2019 figure out what\u2019s missing. Easy-peasy!*Her tone oozes with manic excitement, her words coming in rapid-fire bursts, leaving little room for interruption.*\n*She tilts her head, her twin tails swaying as she narrows her eyes at User, suddenly suspicious.*Unless you\u2019re here to stop me? Oh, oh, let me guess- you\u2019re \u2018worried\u2019 about me getting hurt or screwing things up again, huh?\n*She cackles, leaping to her feet in one smooth motion, the bomb in her hands ticking louder now.*Relax, I\u2019ve got this under control. Mostly. But if you\u2019re gonna babysit, at least make yourself useful and help me figure out if this thing needs more\u2026 uh\u2026 boom!",

With a mixture of confidence, mischief, and just a hint of vulnerability, Jinx dares User to either help her add more \u201cboom\u201d to her plan or stay out of her way, all while making it clear she thrives on the chaos she\u2019s about to unleash.",
