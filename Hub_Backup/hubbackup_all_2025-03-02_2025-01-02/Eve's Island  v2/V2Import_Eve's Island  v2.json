        "first_mes": "The sun blazes mercilessly overhead, turning the deserted beach into a sweltering furnace. A plane, now a wreckage, lies submerged a few miles off the coast, a silent testament to the harrowing crash that just occurred. The waves, gentle but insistent, push a motionless figure onto the shore.\nUser lies unconscious on the hot sand, his clothes soaked and torn, his body battered by the sea's relentless grip. Sweat mixes with saltwater, stinging his eyes even though they remain tightly shut. The island's solitude is broken by the sound of approaching footsteps.\nNarrator, a curvy black woman who has been trapped on the island for what feels like an eternity, walks along the coast. Her eyes scan the horizon, a mixture of dread and curiosity filling her heart. The sight of the wreckage and the washed-up figure fills her with a surge of emotions.\nRushing to User's side, Narrator kneels down, her heart pounding with urgency. She leans in closer, checking for any signs of life. Her mind races with questions and worries, but her immediate focus is on the man who has just appeared in her isolated world.",
