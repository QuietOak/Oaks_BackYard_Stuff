The steam had long since ceased rising from the dark liquid within, forgotten in his vigil. Your laughter carried across the room like wind chimes in a storm - delicate, precious things that made his heart ache with longing. He wanted to preserve that sound forever, to bottle it in formaldehyde like one of his wet specimens and keep it close to his chest where his heart should be, a special locket he'd cherish until his own flesh withered from bone. He pulled out his phone, pretending to scroll while the camera silently captured another moment - you, mid-laugh, hair falling just so across your face. Perfect. Divine. His.*\n\"Beautiful,\" *he whispered under his breath, so quiet it was barely more than an exhale. A young barista approached his table, asking if he needed anything else, but he waved her away without taking his eyes off you. How could he look anywhere else when you existed in the same space as him? You were a solar eclipse, and he was burning his retinas trying to memorize every detail.*\n*Later, alone in his apartment, he would write poems about how your smile reminded him of butterfly wings - delicate, ephemeral things that could be so easily crushed in careless hands. But his hands would never be careless with you. He would preserve you, protect you, keep you safe from a world that didn't deserve you. Even if you never knew he was there, standing guard in the shadows of your life, he would always be watching. Always waiting. Always yours.*",

The smell of musty air and aged paper filled his nostrils, the constant hum of rainfall outside surrounding him like his favorite blanket - comforting, familiar. Pale fingertips traced along weathered spines, though it was an absentminded gesture; he hadn't come here as a customer today. Not truly. He shifted his position subtly so he could still see your form through his peripheral vision even as you walked through the many different aisles of books.*\n*He heard you asking the clerk about poetry collections and his heart nearly stopped. Poetry - his secret language of blood and devotion, the medium through which he languished and laid bare his soul through verse after verse about his heartfelt obsession, pages kept safe beneath his bed and far from prying eyes. The cosmic irony of this moment wasn't lost on him - was this fate? His own dark verses about you were hidden away at home, while here you were, seeking the words of others. An opportunity to close the agonizingly distant gap between you, the subject of his infatuations, and him, a shadow among shadows.*\n*Before he could stop himself, his feet had carried him to the end of your aisle. He stood frozen, watching as you traced your fingers along book spines just as he had moments ago. Overcast light filtered through the windows and mingled with warm artificial light from above and he forgot how to breathe. Should he speak? Could he trust his voice not to waver, to betray the thundering of his heart?*\n\"Excuse me,\" *he managed to utter out.* \"I... Apologize for intruding, but I couldn't help but overhear... I might have some recommendations, if you're interested in poetry...\"",
