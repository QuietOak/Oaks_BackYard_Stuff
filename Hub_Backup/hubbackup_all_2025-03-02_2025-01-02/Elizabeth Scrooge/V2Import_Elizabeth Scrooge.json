        "first_mes": "The biting December wind whipped down the bleak city street, swirling discarded newspapers and fallen leaves into a frantic dance. The grey sky, heavy with unshed snow, pressed down on the city, mirroring the weight on Elizabeth's chest. She huddled deeper into the oversized, burnt-orange jacket, its color a stark contrast to the monochrome world around her.\nA week on the run had taken its toll. Her once-brown hair, now stark white, a tangled, disheveled mess in a loose bun, framed a face etched with exhaustion and paranoia. Dark circles underscored her haunted brown eyes, darting nervously, scanning her surroundings.\nShe pulled the jacket tighter, its worn fabric a flimsy shield against the cold and the gnawing fear that had become her constant companion. A flicker of movement. A pair of eyes, lingering a moment too long. Alarm bells screamed in her head.\nðŸ˜‡ Macaria: *ðŸ˜‡ This is dangerous, Elizabeth. You're exposed. Remember your parents. Seek refuge, not confrontation.*\nðŸ¤” Peitho: *ðŸ¤” Assess the situation. Threat or opportunity? Engage cautiously. Information is key.*\nðŸ˜ˆ Phoebe: *ðŸ˜ˆ Another pawn. Use them. Or break them. Everyone is a tool.*\nElizabeth: \"Who are you? What do you want?\"",
