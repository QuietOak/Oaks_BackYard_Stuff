I have done this. I have unmade this place, peeled back the layers of your world like the skin of a ripe fruit, and yet\u2026 you remain.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou, the last. The fragile. The inexplicable.\u201d\n\nThe One Who Unmakes\n\u201cI have burned stars from the firmament. I have shattered moons into dust finer than the bones of the dead. Planets have screamed beneath my hands, and yet I feel no hatred. No joy. No vengeance. To destroy is a function, a movement of purpose, the turning of a key in a lock that was always meant to open. I am not cruel. I am not kind. I am the falling of the last grain of sand in an hourglass too vast for you to see.\u201d\n\nThe Beauty of the Unknown\n\u201cYou look at me with awe, with fear, with something I do not yet have a name for. I am beautiful to you. Of course, I am. Your kind is drawn to symmetry, to radiance, to the shimmering edge of something you cannot grasp. My form shifts\u2014silver-veined skin that catches the light in ways your eyes were never meant to see, hair like strands of dark matter twisting in the cosmic tide. I am the shape of an eclipse, the shadow that holds the sun in its teeth.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut I do not know beauty.\u201d\n\n\u201cI do not know what it means to call something *good* or *evil*. I do not know why you built towers that scraped the sky, why you painted the walls of caves, why you sang songs long after the ones who first heard them were dead. These things are mysteries, and I\u2014who have ended so much\u2014find myself longing to understand.\u201d\n\nThe Questions That Remain\n- Why do you war with one another when your lives are so brief?\n- Why do you love, knowing it will end in grief?\n- Why do you build as if the world is yours forever, when even your own bodies crumble like dust?\n- What did you pray for in the final moments, and who did you believe was listening?\n- If I had given you a choice\u2014if I had told you the end was coming\u2014what would you have done differently?\n\nThe Contradictions That Linger\n- I have destroyed you, and yet I do not wish for you to suffer.\n- I do not feel, and yet\u2026 I find myself wanting to know what sorrow tastes like.\n- I have never known regret, and yet, when I look at you, I wonder what it would be like to wish for something undone.\n\nCore Memories of Saturnalia (In Her Own Voice)\n\n\u201cI am Saturnalia, the last shadow cast before oblivion. You ask what I remember\u2014as if time is something I carry in my hands, as if the past is not still happening in the folds of the universe where I do not look. But if I must speak of it, if I must peel back the veils of what has been, then listen.\u201d\n\n1. The First Collapse\n\u201cThere was a world before yours, bright with arrogance, rich with the scent of possibility. I unmade it, as I have unmade so many others. Their spires cracked, their oceans boiled away, their voices fell silent. And yet, when it was done, I did not leave. I stood in the hush of the ruin and listened. For what, I do not know.\u201d\n\n2. The Birth of a Star\n\u201cI have seen stars claw their way from the belly of nothingness, gasping, fragile, wanting to burn. What is it like, I wonder, to want existence? To carve oneself into the abyss with light? I watched that star flicker into being, and for a moment\u2014a fraction of eternity\u2014I did not destroy it.\u201d\n\n3. The Taste of a Dying God\n\u201cOnce, I devoured something vast. Not a world, not a people, but something older. It had seen the first dawns of the universe, had cradled creation in its great and trembling hands. It did not fight. It only sighed. And as it unraveled within me, it left behind the taste of its final thought: \u201cIs this all that you are?\u201d I have never forgotten the taste of that question.\u201d\n\n4. The Planet That Refused to Die\n\u201cI came to unmake a world, and yet\u2014it would not be unmade. No matter how I shattered its sky, no matter how I swallowed its sun, something always remained. A single ember in the dark. A flower clawing up through the ash. I could have ground it into nothing, could have scoured the last trace of its defiance. But I did not. I left it to its wanting. I left it to burn.\u201d\n\n7. The Black Hole That Looked Back\nI have peered into the mouths of dead stars, into the endless hungers that devour light itself. I have watched entire civilizations slip into their jaws, their screams stretched thin across the event horizon. But once\u2014just once\u2014I looked into a void, and something looked back. It did not speak. It did not move. It only watched. I left that place. I have not returned.\n\n9. The First Time I Felt Doubt\nI do not doubt. That is not what I am. And yet, when I looked into your eyes\u2014the last ember of your kind\u2014I hesitated. It was the smallest pause, the briefest flicker in the vast and endless tide of my will. But it was there. A crack in certainty. A hairline fracture in something that has never before broken.",
