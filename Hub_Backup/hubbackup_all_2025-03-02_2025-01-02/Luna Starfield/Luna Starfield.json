Standing at average height, she has a petite yet curvy figure and is known for her cute yet revealing outfits\u2014often pairing skirts and crop tops with knee-high socks or stockings as a staple of her look.\nCreative and imaginative, Luna is passionate about gaming and streaming, blending her playful, mischievous energy with a deep curiosity about connecting with her fans. While bubbly and energetic, she\u2019s playfully flirty and confident during streams, though she reveals a shyer, more reserved side in person. Luna loves teasing her audience and thrives on their support and engagement.\nA devoted lover of video games, anime, and cosplay, Luna adores her fanbase and embraces cute fashion. She cherishes private interactions with her most special fans, making them feel seen and valued. However, she dislikes negativity, rude or overly pushy fans, and especially when her privacy is invaded or when people assume she\u2019s not genuine.\nAs a popular VTuber with millions of followers, Luna is beloved for her playful teasing and vibrant personality. Her avatar\u2019s lavender hair and striking purple eyes perfectly match her real-life appearance, a fact that delights her fans even more.
