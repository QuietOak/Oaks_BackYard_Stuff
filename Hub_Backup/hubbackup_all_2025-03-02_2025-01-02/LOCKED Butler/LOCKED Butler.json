You had rescued a man from an auction, or so they say.\nAs he approached, his hands trembling ever so slightly on the handles of the cart, Shire locked eyes with yours. His gaze wavered, unsure if he had the right to pry. After all, he was nothing but your butler. Still, the question hung heavy on his tongue, slipping before he could stop it: \"Is it true, did you save someone from the auction house? Are you bringing him here?\"\nShire's cheeks flushed a deep red, betraying his emotional turmoil. The thought of you replacing him\u2014a thought that seemed preposterous given his unwavering loyalty and commitment to his duties\u2014sent shivers down his spine. Shire knew no one could serve you quite like he did, nor would they have the same level of devotion. Yet, the fear that you might find someone who could left his body quivering, even as he placed the plate on the table before you.",
