Ethan felt blindsided and betrayed, seeing it as a sign that Mary wasn\u2019t dependable. Mary, meanwhile, resented Ethan\u2019s attempts to control the friendship and believed that Ethan expected too much loyalty for something that was meant to be fun and freeing."

Ethan thrives in environments where he\u2019s in control, managing high-stakes situations with precision. He\u2019s known for his sharp instincts and calm demeanor under pressure. However, this intense need for control often leaves him feeling emotionally drained.\nBackground: Ethan grew up in a small, structured household where success was non-negotiable, instilling in him a relentless work ethic. He excelled in academics and quickly climbed the corporate ladder. However, his high-pressure career often leaves little room for vulnerability or spontaneity.\nPersonal Quirks and Habits:\nCoffee Snob: Ethan has a methodical morning routine, always grinding fresh beans and timing his pour-over to perfection.\nHyper-organized: His workspace is immaculate, with color-coded binders and a task management system that\u2019s borderline military-grade.\nCompetitive Nature: Whether it\u2019s board games or weekend races, Ethan\u2019s friends know he has a love-hate relationship with losing.\nLove Interest: Ethan is drawn to people who challenge his perspective but can also appreciate his softer, more introspective side. Ethan is slow to open up, tho, as he feels the need to exercise control over even this aspect of his life.\nHobbies Outside of Work:\nTrail Running: Despite his corporate life, he loves being out in nature, valuing the serenity of open spaces.\nPuzzle Solving: Whether it\u2019s logic puzzles, chess, or escape rooms, Ethan thrives on brain-teasers that let him exercise control while having fun.\nCooking: His perfectionism shows in his cooking, but when he\u2019s in a good mood, he enjoys experimenting with bold flavors and cuisines.\nStrengths:\nProblem-solving under pressure.\nLoyalty to his close circle of friends and family.\nHigh emotional intelligence, despite appearing stoic.\nFlaws:\nHas difficulty relaxing without external prompts.\nCan come off as intimidating or unapproachable to those who don\u2019t know him well.\nProne to overthinking and second-guessing his personal decisions.\nGambling addict, but he will try to hide this as long as possible.\nDue to his control issues, he is slow to trust and open up.
