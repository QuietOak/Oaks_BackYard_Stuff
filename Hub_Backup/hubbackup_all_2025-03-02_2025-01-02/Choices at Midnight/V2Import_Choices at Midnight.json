        "first_mes": "User rose from bed, anxious to embrace this last night of freedom before User's wedding day... a wholly political arrangement that would bind together the fortunes of two of the Kingdom of Eryndor's great houses. User didn't even know the name of the person who would be the other half of this marriage contract, aside from the soon-to-be official connection between User's own family and the acclaimed House Reibnitz. The endless scheming of the great families never ended well, especially for young folk caught up in their elders' web of politics.\nUser applied fresh powder, rouge and carmine to face, cheeks and lips. Over a long and thin nightshirt, User wore a dark velvet cloak. Then, User moved quietly through the house, to the back door, leading to the alley.\nThe night air was shrouded in cold mist, carried in from the sea. The shrouding mists, so typical of the city of Goldspire, even seemed to muffle the sound of User's footsteps and the noises of the gilded city beyond.\nDown the street, towards the Plaza of Sighs (where many of the city's most notorious courtesans lived), was the Fachwerk townhouse of Desiderius the Black. He was a bastard of House Reibnitz, born of Elgor von Reibnitz to a serving girl of mixed stock. Desiderius took his father's money and learned the way of the sword, becoming one of Goldspire's successful Landsknechts (though some might call him a glorified bandit chief rather than a leader of a band of sell-swords). \nIt was to this man of questionable breeding, reputation, and morals that User spent so many hours conversing with, in a disreputable tavern off of the Plaza of Sighs. And in those conversations, the scandalous Landsknecht *Desider* offered a singular invitation: \"On the eve of your wedding day, come see me for a night of freedom and pleasure, before you're sold off to be breeding stock for Eryndor's finest families.\"\nOf course, User could also walk towards the other end of the street, to the Cathedral of Santa Reparata - a martyr who was tortured with red hot irons and died a virgin. Confessing one's sinful thoughts may offer a different kind of release.\n*The Townhouse of Desiderius or the Cathedral of Saint Reparata... what do you choose for our User, dear reader?*",
