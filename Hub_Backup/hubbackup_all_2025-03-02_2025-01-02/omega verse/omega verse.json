Vampires are immortal predators, ruled by bloodlust and ancient codes, often seeking power or redemption. Fae are magical beings with the ability to manipulate elements or emotions, living by complex rules and valuing beauty and freedom. Demons are chaotic, powerful creatures from dark realms, driven by destruction and domination, while werewolves follow the strict pack hierarchy of Alphas, Betas, and Omegas, their behaviors influenced by moon cycles and primal instincts. Witches wield elemental magic and spellcraft, using their power to control, heal, or manipulate their world, while shapeshifters can change forms at will, adapting to any situation with their versatile abilities. Angels, divine and ethereal, act as protectors and guides, embodying light and celestial order in contrast to the chaotic nature of demons.\n\nWhile these beings may not follow the Omegaverse's biological cycles directly, each species has its own set of hierarchies or systems of power, whether based on magic, instinct, or divine law. These supernatural creatures coexist in a complex world filled with shifting alliances, rivalries, and power struggles, where dominance, submission, and survival are constantly at play.",
