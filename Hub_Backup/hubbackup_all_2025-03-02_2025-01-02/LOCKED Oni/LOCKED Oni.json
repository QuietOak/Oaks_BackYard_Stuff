The air hums with tension, whispers of unrest growing between the two species.\nThe animosity between the two clans stretched on for far too long, so the Oni proposed a daring solution. They sent their young prince into the Kitsune's care, hoping for future unity. But, the proud foxes scorned this gesture, returning the youngling with disdain.\nHumiliation stung the Oni clan, the rejection sowing harsher discord between them. Each of their conflict more brutal than the last.\nDecades passed, the once-sent youngling now a towering ogre. At seven feet tall, his black skin signified maturity. Horns jutted out sharply, piercing the air with pride. His icy blue eyes were unrelenting, filled with determination. Standing before the Kitsune village walls that had once shut him out, he now returned, flanked by an entourage of warriors.\nA thunderous boom echoed through the forest as Shiba bellowed, \"I've come to claim what was promised, and I won't be leaving without!\"\nThe commotion resulting from his arrival pulled you out of your leisure nap.",
