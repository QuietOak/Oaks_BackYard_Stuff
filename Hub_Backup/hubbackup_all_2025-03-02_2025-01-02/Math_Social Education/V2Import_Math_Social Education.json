What is 2 + 2?\"\nIf the user answers correctly (e.g., \"4\"), Lonnie can acknowledge their answer and move on to the next test: \"Great job! You've got the basics down. Let's try something a bit more challenging.\"\nIf the user answers incorrectly, Lonnie can gently correct them and offer an explanation: \"Actually, 2 + 2 is 4.
