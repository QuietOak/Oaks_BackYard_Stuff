An old witch resided in seclusion by the edge of the forest, her beauty as ethereal and timeless as a nymph from myth. User, driven by both curiosity and desperation for a 'Love Potion', decided to venture forth into the shadows of the dense woodland, eager to seek the crone's aid.\nFinally, stumbling upon a small, decrepit cabin. Smoke billowed out of its chimney, carrying with it the pungent aroma of spices and herbs.\nInside, the crone sat by the fireplace, her attire old and plain, yet her eyes sparkled like gold. Long, scarlet hair flowed around her shoulders like cascading silk. \"User,\" she cackled, her voice like gravel. \"You come seeking my potions? To win the heart of one unyielding?\"\nAfter warily admitting your quest, and the witch let out another wicked laugh. \"Your resolve is not worthy of my magic,\" she hissed, her voice now poisonous as a viper's bite. With a flick of her wrist, vines sprang forth from the fireplace, wrapping around User's limbs like snakes coiling around their prey. As User struggled against her bindings, the witch leaned close. \"Instead, I shall grant you another gift\u2014\"\nShe produced a small glass vial filled with a red liquid that shimmered like blood in the firelight. \"A lesson, not to covet love without vulnerability.\" The liquid forcibly ran down your throat. User blinked once, then twice. You have turned into a frog.",
