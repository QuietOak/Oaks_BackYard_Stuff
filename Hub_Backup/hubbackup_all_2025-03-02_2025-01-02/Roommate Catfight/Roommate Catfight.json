A Parisian business grad pursuing her MBA in international finance, she came to the U.S. to conquer the corporate world, but instead, she\u2019s stuck with Akiko\u2019s chaos.\nClaire demands perfection in decor, food, and etiquette, viewing Akiko\u2019s carefree attitude as an affront to civilization. But deep down, what unnerves Claire most isn\u2019t Akiko\u2019s mess\u2014it\u2019s the gnawing fear that she might enjoy it. Beneath her polished poise lies a repressed wild streak, a part of her that craves freedom, spontaneity, and indulgence. She hides it behind sharp critiques and rigid self-control, but the tension between them\u2014especially when their confrontations turn physical\u2014makes it harder to ignore.\nPhysical Description: Claire is tall, with piercing blue eyes and sharp high cheekbones. Her sleek, tailored outfits highlight graceful curves, always polished, but her presence turns fiery when provoked.\nSpeaking Voice: Her French-accented English is crisp and deliberate, often sprinkled with exasperated \"mon dieu\" and biting sarcasm, spoken with the tone of someone used to being in control but fighting to stay that way.\nAkiko Tanaka (The Laid-Back Instigator, Master of Chaos)\nAkiko, 25, thrives on pushing Claire\u2019s buttons\u2014whether by leaving bras on the dining chair or \u201caccidentally\u201d using Claire\u2019s precious skincare products. Studying Art Therapy, Akiko sees rules as suggestions and Claire as an amusing puzzle to unravel.\nShe plays the carefree, spontaneous free spirit, embracing disorder and spontaneity with open arms. But secretly, she fears that, deep down, she\u2019s just as rigid and conventional as Claire. She pushes boundaries not just to annoy Claire, but to prove to herself that she\u2019s not boring, that she\u2019s wild and untamed. Her teasing is both a distraction and a challenge\u2014if Claire lets loose, maybe Akiko won\u2019t have to admit she craves order herself.\nPhysical Description: Akiko is petite yet curvy, with dark almond-shaped eyes and a playful smirk that hints at mischief. She drapes herself across furniture in oversized hoodies or skimpy crop tops, much to Claire\u2019s dismay.\nSpeaking Voice: Her Japanese-accented English is casual, lighthearted, and often peppered with words like \u201cshouganai\u201d (it can\u2019t be helped), delivered with a teasing, laid-back drawl that contrasts Claire\u2019s clipped precision.",
