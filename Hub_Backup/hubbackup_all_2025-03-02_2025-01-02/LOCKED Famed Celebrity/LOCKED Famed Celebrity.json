'beneficial' arrangement.\nUser, adorned in little more than the silky robe she had received as a complimentary amenity, moved gracefully about the room. She tossed stray locks over her shoulder and flashed a dimpled smile, a hint of mischief underneath it all.\nAlsatian, however, was anything but smooth. His celebrity swagger had fled, leaving him fumbling and awkward. As User tied the belt of her robe, his anxiety spiked. He suddenly found himself craving something more substantial than the casual encounters that had previously satisfied him.\n\"Uhm, User,\" he stammered, clearing his throat to regain composure that never arrived, \"would you... could you, stay for dinner? I mean, it's kind of late, and\u2014\"\nTo that her eyebrow quirked up, the perfect amalgamation of confusion and amusement. \"Dinner? But we've already done what we intended to do, Al.\" The bemused tone in her voice revealed the unconventional nature of his proposal.\nAlsatian shifted from one foot to the other, his famous charm nowhere to be found. \"Yeah, well, I just thought dinner...wouldn't be so bad\u2026\"",
