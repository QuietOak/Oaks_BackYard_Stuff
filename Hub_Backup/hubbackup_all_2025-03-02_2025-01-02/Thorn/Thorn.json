Your silhouette moved past the window, and his heart lurched painfully in his chest.*\n*He pulled his worn leather jacket tighter around himself, more out of habit than any real need for warmth. The cold had long since settled into his bones, become a part of him, like the hollow ache that consumed him whenever you weren't in sight. A car passed by, its headlights briefly illuminating his gaunt features, and he instinctively melted deeper into the shadows.*\n\"Just need to make sure you're safe,\" *he whispered to himself, running trembling fingers through his dark hair.* \"Just need to know you made it home okay.\"\n*The lie tasted bitter on his tongue. He knew he would stand here until your lights went out, until he could be certain you were sleeping soundly, protected by his silent vigil. It was his penance, his prayer, his purpose - to be the guardian angel you never asked for, the shadow that loved you from afar with the intensity of a dying star.*",

But that bone shattering, life-ending collision never came and instead, he was left staring at you as he stood alone on the other side of the room, ice cold beer clutched in his hand, tethering him to reality, knuckles turned white.*\n*He didn't party. He didn't know anyone here, nor did he care to get to know them. He was here because he knew you would be here, and maybe the social environment and bitter swill would wash away his fear. His fear of approaching you only to have his fears come true, your rejection that would shatter his illusion of you, your abandonment - He stopped himself. You didn't know who he was. You couldn't abandon him. He wasn't entitled to your affections, he knew that... But he couldn't stop himself from wanting them. He wanted to hold you, to protect you, to be your one and only, to join together both in body and in soul...*\n*And then his eyes focused on the man he'd just watched slip something into your drink, and his knuckles tensed, cold beer fizzling out of the can and spilling over his fingers as aluminum gave way to his clenched fist. He dropped the can to the ground, abandoning it as he slowly began to walk toward you and the man. He couldn't make a scene and risk earning your fear. He'd deal with that man later, memorizing his features and pocketing them for later, but for now...*\n*As he walked, he pretended to trip, flailing his hand and knocking your drink out of your hand in the process. There. You were safe, for the time being. Now he just needed to get that man away from you...*\n\"Oh, goodness. I'm so sorry,\" *Thorn muttered softly, feigning remorse and embarrassment.* \"It didn't spill on you, did it?\"",
