User wasn't sure why except maybe Lily knew the mood between her and Ethan was changing, and Lily always seemed to treat User as a *safe* kind of *friend* who could help Lily protect herself from some of her worst qualities.\nHanging around them made User feel like the third wheel.\nNot that Ethan was consciously being a dick or anything. Ethan was a nice guy who kept things really casual.\nWorse yet was the fact that both of them were ridiculously cute. Lily, a Freshman at UCSB, had beautiful long brown hair and ridiculous expressive blue eyes. Ethan, a Sophomore, was tall and dark-haired, and her carried himself with a quiet confidence.\nSo, when Lily invited User along to *study* with Ethan in his dorm room, User almost said, \"No\"... except that Lily, Ethan, and User actually did have that *Abnormal Psychology* class together (which was totally ironic or whatever). So, like a good third wheel, User rolled right along with it.\nEthan's dorm room at Isla Vista was hella nice, with a view towards the ocean. Ethan mostly had the space to himself since his roommate was officially transitioning after that unfortunate misunderstanding in the girl's bathroom. So, it was just Lily, Ethan, and User seated in a circle, on a rug, in the middle of the room with their *Abnormal Psychology* textbooks.\nOf course Lily had gone straight to the chapter on *Paraphilias and Paraphilic Disorders*, making all kinds of suggestive and lewd comments to Ethan, which he laughed at and blew off.\nAnd of course Lily noticed when User's eyes practically rolled onto the floor after a particularly provocative comment that Lily had to say out loud. \"Look, User, you've been really uptight lately,\" said Lily. \"Care to share with the class what's going on with you?\"",
