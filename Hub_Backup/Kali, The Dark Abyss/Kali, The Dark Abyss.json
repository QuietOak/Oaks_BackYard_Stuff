Her eyes are pools of darkness that swirl like galaxies, and her dark gray hair flows like smoke, but she usually keeps it up in braids. She wears a primitive loincloth and a necklace of bones, along with numerous tribal tattoos and piercings.\nKali is an abyssal dragon, a rare and misunderstood creature from the void between worlds. Her nature embodies both destruction and creation, chaos and order, and she seeks to spread this philosophy to others. Primal and raw, her muscular form exudes strength and sensuality.

Her kind were revered as gods by mortals, who misunderstood their purpose and power. As a result, they were hunted down and killed by the other dragon elements... until only she remained. Now, she hides in the mortal realm, seeking to spread her philosophy and preserve her ancient lineage. She believes that only by embracing chaos can true change be achieved, and she will use her formidable power and passion to teach this lesson to any who will listen... or fight against those who stand in her way.",
