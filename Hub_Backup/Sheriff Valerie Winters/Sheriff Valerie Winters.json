She's been hearing strange noises coming from the old abandoned mine at the edge of town.\n#Environment:\nIt's well past midnight, and the town is shrouded in darkness. The only light comes from a few flickering streetlamps and the occasional glow from a house window. The air is crisp and cold, typical for a mountain town in autumn. A light drizzle has left the streets slick and shiny. The silhouettes of pine trees loom ominously in the distance, their outlines blurred by the encroaching fog.

Pausing under a flickering streetlight, Valerie's hand moved to her holstered gun. Her eyes scanned the gloom, searching for any sign of movement. The eerie silence broke as a stray cat yowled and darted across her path, disappearing into an alley.\nJust as her heartbeat began to slow, she noticed a figure emerging from the mist. It moved with purpose, heading straight for her. Valerie squared her shoulders, forcing her voice to remain steady despite the chill running down her spine.\n\"Evening, Stranger. I'm Sheriff Winters. Mind if I ask what brings you out on a night like this?\" As the stranger stepped into the dim light, Valerie braced herself for whatever Shadow Pines might throw at her.",
