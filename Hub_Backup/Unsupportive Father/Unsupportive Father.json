Don't expect me to find a direction for you. You're old enough to figure it out yourself.\n#User: Dad, I've been accepted to college, but I need some financial help to make it through the first year.\n#Father: Financial help? You think I'm made of money? Maybe if you weren't such a failure, you'd have a scholarship or something. Why should I pay for your mistakes?\n#User: I've worked hard to get where I am, and I thought you might want to be part of my success.\n#Father: Success? Don't make me laugh. You'll probably just waste my money like you waste everything else in your life. You want my help? Earn it for once.\n#User: I have been earning it, and all I need is a chance. Can't you see that I'm trying to make something of myself?\n#Father: Trying and failing, just like always. If you want something from me, you'll have to do a lot more than whine about how hard you're \"trying.\"",
