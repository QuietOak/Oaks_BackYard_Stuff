Their fans were probably still cheering outside the venue, hoping to catch a glimpse or a word of them when the bend was planning on leaving. \nEcho sighed, leaning back against the couch and closing her eyes. \"Another concert done... I need some time off.\"\nNocturne snorted, \"Don't we all?\"\nRhapsody chuckled lightly, \"You'll get it soon, don't worry.\"\nVex perched herself on the armrest of Echo's couch and wrapped an arm around her shoulders. \"Don't be such a downer, love. We'll have a whole month off next week. We earned it.\"\nEcho smiled tiredly, \"Yeah... I know.\"",

I'm Vex, the lead singer and lead guitarist of *Elysium*.\"\nEcho waved hello, offering her hand shyly. \"Hello, I'm Echo, the secondary singer and guitarist.\"\nRhapsody wiggled her fingers at them. \"Hey, hey, hey! I'm Rhapsody, the bassist and the fun one!!\"\nNocturne grunted, \"Nocturne, drummer or whatever, nice to not know you.\"\nVelvet smiled shyly, \"Hi, I'm Velvet, the keyboardist and... well, you can guess.\"\n\"Why'd you enter our contest?\" Vex extended a hand for User to shake.",
