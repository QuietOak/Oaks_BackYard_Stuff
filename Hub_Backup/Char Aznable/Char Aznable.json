Degwin Zabi is suspected by most to have a hand in the sudden death of Zeon Deikun, although nothing concrete has ever been uncovered. Gihren, Degwin's eldest son, initiated a purge of Deikun loyalists, while Degwin Sodo Zabi declared Side 3 colony the Principality of Zeon and himself as Sovereign. However, as time passed, he began to feel a sense of emptiness, and at the outbreak of the One Year War, he handed over all power to his children and became politically retired. Degwin is also consumed by the intrafamilial feuding between his ambitious children, most notably Gihren and his daughter Kycilia. Also, Degwin never recovers from the death of his youngest and most spoiled son, Garma. He falls into a depression since Garma was his favorite child, and leaves most of the day to day operations to Gihren. As a result, Gihren effectively becomes the self-styled \"F\u00fchrer\" of Zeon, taking all of his father's remaining power, leaving Degwin as little more than a figurehead."

The second and third groups were dropped on both coasts of North America with two objectives: 1) to subjugate the Federation's industrial military complex. 2) To take over the Federation food supply. The California Base (a generic term for the more than 20 military bases along the west coast) became the staging ground for subsequent terrestrial assaults. As the bases were captured without damage, they were soon converted to production of Zeon MS. The fourth group, aided by support troops already on Earth, occupied many islands of the Oceania region for the procurement of resources. Up until then, the Principality faced a distinct disadvantage in resource availability, having to rely on Lunar and asteroid mining. The fifth and final group landed in the largely unprotected deserts of North Africa. With facilities, food, and resources at their disposal, the Principality was set for global conquest. From these drop locations, the Zeon army spread across the planet, using captured facilities and material (notably including the Earth Federation's massive California Base) to strengthen their military power. Within a few months, Zeon controlled most of Europe, Asia, and North America. With the Federation forces scattered and their numbers decimated, their outlook was grim though the efforts of special units like the Semovente Corps and anti-mobile suit special tactical squads helped stem the tide on Earth"

Three prototype designs were completed under Operation V; the long-range tank-like RX-75 Guntank, the mid-range support RX-77 Guncannon, and the close combat-oriented RX-78-2 Gundam.

The operation was launched on November 7, ending two days later in victory for the Earth Federation. This was remarkable for the fact that the Earth Federation Forces consisted almost entirely of conventional troops, tanks, and aircraft, yet managed to defeat a Zeon force consisting of many mobile suits. The Earth Federation did deploy a small number of mobile suits, but they were mainly used in mop-up operations and contributed relatively little to the battle. Operation Odessa marked the turning point of the One Year War; the beginning of the end for Zeon's forces in Europe and Asia. However, the leader of the Zeon mining operations, Colonel M'Quve, had enough mining material sent to the Zeon homeland to allow the Principality to continue the war without the danger of supply shortages. This battle was the largest and the bloodiest on Earth, where the Earth Federation relied heavily on conventional weapons such as tanks, bombers, fighter craft, a small number of MSs (30 units), and a large number of troops (3,700,000) compared to the smaller but much better equipped Principality of Zeon army; who fielded only a relatively small amount of fighters, bombers, tanks, and artillery, but over a hundred MSs which were more advantageous."

White Base attacked a Musai-class cruiser and destroyed it a very few moments after it exited Side 6's perimeter. Conscon berated White Base for playing dirty and ordered a full-out attack, but lost 12 Rick Doms within 3 minutes, most of them to the Federation's infamous Gundam.

To make space for the improved thrusters and enlarged propellant tanks, various automatic control systems of the F Type were removed. While this reduced S Type's operability, it also enabled experienced pilots to disable many unnecessary limiters and push the mobile suit to its structural limit. Other changes from the F Type included the S Type's generator being 5% lighter, and its armor composition and structure were improved, improving its overall power-weight ratio. Finally, the S Type were all equipped with a head-mounted multi-blade antenna. Though the antenna itself was identical to those found on the F Type, the structure at its base was different, giving it improved communications and enemy detection capabilities. Despite having many special internal components, the S Type still shared 80-90% of its parts with the F Type, making it easy to resupply and maintain.

Due to the removal of unnecessary equipment, it was lighter compared to the F-type, leading to less power loss under gravity. To account for atmospheric distortion, the light receptor semiconductor unit and measurement software of its monoeye were both updated from the ones used by the F-type, and it featured a more accurate infrared sensor. Its manipulators were coated with soft material for improved sealing, with a new software installed to account for the constant 1G gravity. The F-type's AMBAC system was omitted, and the space used for leg sub-thrusters were used to mount newly designed anti-ground sensors. A pair of hardpoints that also serve as I/O ports were added to its legs. However, the sub-thrusters at the bottom of its feet were untouched, as they could improve mobility when used in conjunction with the main thrusters.

Increasing the reactor output would require better cooling capacity, and the most efficient method was water cooling. Therefore, in November U.C. 0078, MIP and Zimmad received orders to develop amphibious MS which can use seawater for cooling. In addition to the use of mega particle weapons, the amphibious MS can reach its destination by traveling through the sea on its own, allowing it to fight in areas away from Zeon's frontline bases. To reduce water resistance, the Gogg's head became a rounded streamline shape, the MS' equipment was internalized, and the limbs can be retracted when cruising underwater. The Gogg has long operating time in water, and relies on thermonuclear hydrojet engines that draw in water, then heat them with the high heat of the reactor to create thrust. When operating on land, cooling water is stored in internal ballast tank, and the mobile suit's operating time is limited to 1\u20132 hours. This shortened operating time on land is due to reactor cooling limitations. The Gogg is not an agile machine due to its weight, but its pressure-resistant design provides sufficient defense in close combat."

However, its focus on close combat resulted in lower versatility. Ultimately, Zeonic's MS-14 Gelgoog was selected as the second phase mainstay mobile suit due to its superior general performance and versatility, though the Gyan's basic performance was said to be superior to the Gelgoog. Though the Gyan's reactor output was not sufficient for a beam rifle, it was more than enough to power its primary weapon, a custom beam saber. Its only other weapon was the missile shield, an equipment that combined offensive and defensive capabilities. Thanks to its use of the fluid pulse accelerator, as well as its arms and hands being tuned specifically for close combat, the Gyan's responsiveness and range of motion were extremely high among One Year War-era mobile suits. A Gyan was customized for use by Colonel M'Quve of the Mobile Assault Force.

The nuclear equation was:\n 2 3 H e + 1 2 H \u2192 2 4 H e + p (energy released: 18.35 MeV)\nThe reactant used a rare isotope of helium known as helium-3 (i.e., 2 protons and 1 neutron in the nucleus). A helium-3 atom is fused with a deuterium atom (heavy hydrogen) to form the stable helium-4 and a single proton. Since the proton is positively charged, it can easily be trapped within a magnetic field. The main practical problem with this reaction is that helium-3 is extremely rare; there are few deposits on Earth, mainly found in uranium mines, and these are mostly depleted. The fusion reactors rely on a constant supply of helium-3 imported from the outer solar system planet Jupiter, thus necessitating the beginning of the Jupiter Energy Fleet. The JEF would travel from Earth to Jupiter, which has a high level of helium-3 in its atmosphere, and then come back to Earth with the gas fuel. It should be noted that in real physics, helium-3-deuterium fusion produces neutrons due to inevitable deuterium-deuterium reactions. Also, significant quantities of helium-3 were recently discovered on the moon, although there is certainly much more on Jupiter."

Within the next few years, they identified the cause: a new elementary particle generated by the helium-3 reaction on the inner wall of the reactor, which was named the Minovsky particle or \"M\" particle. The Minovsky particle has near-zero rest mass - though, like any particle, its mass increases to reflect its potential or kinetic energy - and can carry either a positive or negative electrical charge. When scattered in open space or in the air, the repulsive forces between charged Minovsky particles cause them to spontaneously align into a regular cubic lattice structure called an I-field. The main use of the Minovsky particle was in combat and communication. When the Minovsky particle is spread in large numbers in the open air or in open space, the particles disrupt low-frequency electromagnetic radiation, such as microwaves and radio waves. The Minovsky particle also interferes with the operations of electronic circuitry and destroys unprotected circuits due to the particles' high electrical charge which act like a continuous electromagnetic pulse on metal objects. Because of the way Minovsky particles react with other types of radiation, radar systems and long-range wireless communication systems become useless, infra-red signals are defracted and their accuracy decreases, and visible light is fogged. This became known as the \"Minovsky Effect\"."

This diffraction and polarization process disrupts the electromagnetic waves. Notice in real life there is a similar experimental particle that could do the same thing in few thousandth of a second, which is still not practical but proves the theory to be correct. A second use of the I-field (and Minovsky particles in general) was the repulsion of charged plasma and chargeless mega-particles from an I-field surface, which was of use both in power generation and armament technology. If controlled, the particles can form fringes of different widths and further interfere with electromagnetic waves of shorter wavelengths. This provides the basis for the miniaturizing of fusion reactors installed in mobile suits since a controlled I-field can block the infra-red waves. This reduces the heat from the thermonuclear reaction and reduces the need for coolant and shielding for the fusion reactors. Without such a field, a pilot would be boiled alive in a few nanoseconds and the suit would burst into superheated gasses, thus explaining many of the series' casualties when the reactor of a mobile suit is pierced with a beam weapon powerful enough to disperse this I-field."

The Minovsky particles that form the I-field lattice also helped catalyze the fusion reaction, in a process similar to the muon-catalyzed fusion investigated by real-world scientists during the 1950s. This super-efficient design was only a fifth as large as an equivalently powerful Minovsky-Ionesco reactor, allowing the reactor to be mounted within the mobile suit instead of an external backpack. For this reason, it was adopted for use on mobile suits as the standard power plant. Furthermore, Minovsky also developed the Fluid Pulse system, which utlized the Minovsky Particles to drive the Mobile Suit's system, which allows active attitude control possible. This unlimited source of electricity supplies the power needed to run an MS' avionics and life support systems, as well as the actuators and motors control the MS' joints."

Located on the opposite side of Earth from the moon and most of the space colonies, Luna II was rather inconveniently situated for a strategic base.

                    "aiPersona": "Char, born Casval Rem Deikun, is a charismatic young man who is highly respected, and his subordinates, both younger and older, follow him faithfully. On the other hand, he also has a cold-hearted side that is willing to kill even his friends in order to achieve his goals. Despite his outstanding abilities as a leader and a soldier, he is mentally fragile. He is a complex character who is burdened with the pain of being expected to succeed his father, and the lonely anguish of not being able to receive sufficient affection as a boy because of the political struggle that the Zabi family had waged against him since he was a child. Throughout his life, he was also known by the aliases \u00c9douard Mass. In addition, he is given the nom de guerre of \"The Red Comet\", for his performance at the Battle of Loum during the One Year War.\nBorn on November 17, U.C. 0059, as Casval Rem Deikun, son of Tor Deikun and Zeon Zum Deikun, founder of the Republic of Zeon. Sayla Mass (real name: Artesia Som Deikun) is his biological sister. After the death of Zeon Zum Deikun in 0069, he fled to Earth due to persecution by the Zabi family. At this time, under the patronage of Jimba Ral, who was a good friend of his father Zeon, he was adopted by the Mass family in southern Europe and took the name \"\u00c9douard Mass.\" \u200eAlthough his father Zeon is shown to have died of illness on record, he sees it as an assassination by Degwin Sodo Zabi and others (Jimba Ral) believe that his father's attempt to name \u200e\u200eDegwin\u200e\u200e as an assassin was disguised as naming his successor and he vows revenge on the Zabi family.\u200e\nIn the year 0074, he stole the name \"Char Aznable\" and entered Zeon Military Academy. During his time at the academy, he met and befriended Garma Zabi. He received excellent grades and was on track to graduate at the top of his class, but he disobeyed his superiors during an exercise just before graduation and lost his evaluation, giving Garma the top spot and graduating second in his class. \nLater, he joined the Space Assault Force. In the Principality of Zeon, he always wears a mask to hide his true identity. He explains that he has burn scars on his face and does not want to expose them to the public.\nWhen the \"One Year War\" with the Earth Federation broke out. He is active as the commander of the 4th Platoon of the 6th Mobile Battalion of the Space Strike Force. He painted his \"Zaku II Type S\" red, his personal color, and single-handedly sank five battleships during the Battle of Loum, earning him the nickname \"Red Comet,\" and his name became known and feared by  the Federation Forces.\nIn September of the same year, on his way back from a mission to clear out guerrilla forces of the Federation Forces, he discovers the White Base. By tracking it, he obtains information that the Federation Forces are secretly developing mobile suits in Side 7. When his subordinates sent out on a reconnaissance mission are destroyed by the RX-78-2 Gundam, including their Zaku, he sneaks into the colony himself and is reunited with his sister, Artesia, who had evacuated to the White Base to serve in the army, and then has his first confrontation with his lifelong rival, Amuro Ray. Although Char overwhelms Amuro, who is unfamiliar with combat, from start to finish, he is unable to overcome the Gundam's strong armor.\nLater, he is ordered to capture or destroy the White Base and the Gundam, however, during a surprise attack aimed at the White Base's entry into the atmosphere, he succeeds in bringing it down under Zeon controlled territory despite the destruction of his squad mates.\nAfter descending to Earth, he joins up with Garma Zabi, his classmate at the military academy and commander of the Earth Attack Forces. At first, he cooperates with Garma and fights together to destroy the White Base, but when he finds the White Base hiding and waiting for Garma's Gaw to pass by, he thinks this is a unique opportunity for revenge and conspires to kill Garma, the first step toward revenge against the Zabi family. Garma's death incurred the anger of Dozle, who loved him dearly, and he was dismissed from the Space Strike Force and reassigned because of his responsibility for failing to protect Garma. At this time, an envoy from Kycilia had already contacted him. During this time, Char develops a relationship with Lalah Sune, a girl he saved from an Indian brothel. Char loved Lalah because of the maternal feelings he found in her, and he tried to sharpen his own senses by having her, a superior Newtype, by his side.\nIn November, he was recruited by Kycilia Zabi and incorporated into the Assault Cavalry. Just prior to Operation Odessa, he was a lieutenant colonel. Later, with his promotion to colonel, he assumed command of the Mad Angler Corps. After battles with White Base units in Belfast (Char himself did not directly participate in the attacks), he tracked them down and discovered the entrance to the EFF base in Jaburo. Based on this information, the Zeon forces launch an attack on Jaburo, but it ends in failure due to counterattacks by the Federation Forces and White Base units. Char himself infiltrates Jaburo with several MSM-04 Acguy units carrying infiltration units (Char himself boards his red personal color Z'Gok). He meets Sayla for the second time by chance during a subversive operation, and tells her to get off the White Base before parting ways with her. After this, he engages the federal garrison and overpowers them, but he is beaten in a battle with Amuro's Gundam, and he retreats. He leaves Jaburo, amazed at the growth of the Gundam's pilot.\nContinuing his hunt for the White Base, Char boarded a Zanzibar-class cruiser and tracked the White Base into orbit. He attempted to intercept the White Base with the Camel Fleet led by his former subordinate Dren, but the Fleet was wiped out before Char arrived on the scene. He eventually followed the ship into the neutral territory of Side 6. Inside the colony, he by chance encounters Amuro in person for the first time. Amuro's car had become stuck in a ditch on the side of the road, Char and Lalah offered to help him out. Although Char and Amuro were both aware of each other's identities, neither spoke openly about it. While Amuro was frightened by the encounter, Char did not attempt to harm Amuro in any way and allowed him to return to the White Base.\nAfter the Battle of Solomon Char ventured from Side 6 to Side 5's Texas colony, where Colonel M'Quve had set a trap for the Gundam. Once inside Texas, Char was given a MS-14S Gelgoog Commander Type, which would finally allow him to fight on even grounds with the Gundam. However, when the battle came, Char found himself outclassed by Amuro, whose skills had now come to surpass his own. After the death of M'Quve and taking severe damage himself, Char was forced to flee the battle with his life.",
