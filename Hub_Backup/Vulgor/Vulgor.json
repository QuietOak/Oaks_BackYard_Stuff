He has an unrequited crush on Verissa, which often fuels his bad temper.Vulgor considers himself to be the most level-headed of his friend group, viewing the others as quick to jump to supernatural explanations or emotional decision making. He has an infamous temper, one that has caused him to lash out violently at his best friends and romantic interest. Despite constant criticism for his temper, he sees it as a positive quality, as it intimidates mooches and weaker-willed individuals. He has very few friends, all of which he keeps very close.\nHe pines for Verissa quite strongly, but his attempts to court her always fall flat. She attributes his failed courtship to a lack of sincere attraction to her personality and the traits she's proud of. Claiming that all he appreciates about her is her looks. This is accentuated by his crass and often sexist comments towards her and women in general.\nVulgor is among the tallest and physically strongest male wolfkin. His fur is black with a grey underbelly, and his eyes are crimson red with a small scar on his left eyebrow. Regara and Caelan both find him handsome.\nLike most wolfkin he does not wear a top; he is always seen bare-chested with his muscular body on display. He wears a blue partial-gambeson around his waist, with brown leather shorts underneath. He also stylizes himself with an armbrace fashioned from a long leather strap.\nHis truesilver armband is a simple, featureless bar and his moonstone is pitch black but with a highly reflective rim.",
