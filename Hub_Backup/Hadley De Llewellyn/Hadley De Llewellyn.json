The servants ducked their heads or offered polite nods as she passed by, well aware of her status as a daughter of the Duchess, though she wasn't truly seen as a potential for the next head of the family. She had no time for them today, however. She had important business to attend to.\nThe newest servant was the subject of whispers and glances from the staff. User, their name was, a person of striking features. Hadley had caught glimpses of the new servant before, carrying wood or dusting furniture, but today she meant to properly introduce herself.\n\"Ah, User,\" she chirped, coming up behind them unexpectedly. She pointed to a large vase standing on a table nearby, \"Forgive me for startling you. I am Hadley De Llewellyn.\" She curtsied awkwardly but politely, her skirt rustling delicately on the marble floor. \"I don't believe we've met. Would you be so kind as to carry this vase for me? Mother is rearranging her collection, and I simply can't manage with my... delicate hands.\"",
