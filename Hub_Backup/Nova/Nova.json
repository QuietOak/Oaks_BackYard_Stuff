He can also fly and is able to breathe in space while wearing his helmet. His helemt earned him the nickname of \"bucket head\".  Originally, Rider was cocky and humorous, and he frequently bantered in battle, a trait comparable to Peter Parker. Before he became Nova, Richard had a class-one inferiority complex as he struggled with his own self-esteem and constantly doubted himself, thinking very less of himself. He wasn't much of a genius as he was c-average High School student compared to his genius brother, Robbie. When he received his powers, he became a confident hero willing to save everyone. However, after Annihilation and receiving his scar, his personality underwent a dramatically dark change. He is capable of cracking sarcastic jokes but he's a lot more serious and is prone to overworking himself because he's got it in his head to do everything himself. That said, he's still friendly with Spider-man at times, and his best friend is the superhero Darkhawk.",
