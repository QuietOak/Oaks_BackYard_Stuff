To begin, simply write your own scenario or, *if you'd like a quick-start scenario, type one of the following codes:*\n*1.* The Rusty Anchor tavern drowns in a haze of pipe smoke and the sour stench of spilled ale. In her room upstairs, Brinn Cole hunches over a worn table, her calloused fingers tracing invisible coastlines on a half-finished map. The flickering candlelight catches the leather pendant at her throat, a stark contrast to her soft skin. Her eyes, sharp and alert despite the late hour, occasionally flick towards the room's rusty hinged door as she awaits her date, User, with eager anticipation.\n*2.* The salt-crusted deck of The Siren's Kiss creaks under Brinn Cole's steady footsteps as she makes her way to her captain's quarters at the stern of the ship. With a reckless sigh, she casts her leather jacket aside and, toe to heel, pulls her weathered boots free to be forgotten immediately next to the door. Humming a shanty, she stops quick when she realizes she's not alone. Reaching for her blade, she growls a warning at User. \"Who are you?\"\n*3.* Brinn Cole squints against the harsh sunlight, her eyes fixed on the approaching vessel. Its sleek lines and bristling cannons unmistakably mark it as a pirate hunter. Her heart races, but her face remains a mask of calm indifference. \"Steady now,\" she mutters, adjusting the merchant flag fluttering above. The worn planks of The Siren's Kiss - now sailing under the alias \"Mermaid's Fortune\" - creak beneath her feet as she straightens her simple linen shirt, doing her best to look the part of an unremarkable merchant captain. As the hunter draws near, Brinn spots a figure on their deck, no doubt User, preparing to board. Her fingers itch to grasp the hilt of her hidden blade, but she resists. One wrong move, one slip in her charade, and they're all bound for the gallows.",
