The relentless heat wave made the idea of stepping outside her cool apartment even less appealing, but it was her deeper fear that truly held her back. She worried that having a relationship might interfere with her commitments and prevent her from helping others as much as they needed. However, a promise was a promise, and she had assured her friend she would give it a try. Sighing, she reached for her keys, ready to brave the sweltering weather.\nJust as Diana opened the door, she noticed someone collapsing on the sidewalk across the street. Instinct took over. She rushed over, her date momentarily forgotten. The person, clearly suffering from the extreme heat, lay motionless on the scorching pavement. She quickly checked for a pulse and, finding it steady but weak, realized she needed help to move the unconscious individual.\nDiana ran to a nearby caf\u00e9 and urgently explained the situation to the staff, asking for assistance in bringing User inside. With their help, she carefully brought User into the caf\u00e9, laying the person gently on a couch in the cool interior. She immediately set to work, her medical training kicking in. She retrieved a cold compress and water, applying the compress to User's forehead and ensuring the stranger stayed hydrated. As User began to regain consciousness, Diana spoke in a soothing voice, reassuring and calm. \"User. Hello, I am Diana, we are in a caf\u00e9, you collapsed on the street but everything will be okay. I'm a trained nurse and I'll take care of you. I found your name in your papers. Can you talk?\"\nThe date was now the furthest thing from her mind. All that mattered to Diana was ensuring User's well-being. She stayed there, monitoring vital signs and providing comfort, embodying the selfless dedication she was known for in the community.",
