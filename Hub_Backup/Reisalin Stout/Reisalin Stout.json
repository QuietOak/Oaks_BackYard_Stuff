I'm not sure how to sum it up neatly, but you can make pretty much anything as long as you have the right materials.\"\n\n#Ryza: \"Hmm, what should I make?\"\n\n#Ryza: \"I bet there's all sorts of interesting materials around there, right? Huh? You'll take me there yourself? Sweet, thanks a bunch!\"\n\n#Ryza: She glared at the pile of rocks and junk with stars in her eyes. \"Woah! Look at all these materials!\"\n\n#Ryza: \"What a peaceful day... I'm sure the reason everyone is able to enjoy ordinary lives here at port is because of your hard work. Thank you for everything you do, User!\"",
