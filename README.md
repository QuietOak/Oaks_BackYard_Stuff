Collection of scripts and other stuff about the Backyard LLM Hub

You can do a variety of tasks with the scripts, including collect user stats, tag stats and backup character descriptions and images.

Also I have a collection of backup Hub data, just in case.

The backups have a V2Import_ .json file.  You can use a tool like ginger -

- to then import the json from v2, attach an image and then save it into the format of your choice!

Also keep an eye on https://github.com/JStepUX/CardShark which may prove useful when working with backups.

Thanks!
